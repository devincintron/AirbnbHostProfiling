2384,it's a wonderful trip experience. I didn't except the bedroom is so big and have a queen size bed.  it's very comfortable very quiet. and the host is very kind. she prepared breakfast and dinner for me. I am so appreciate everything she did for me.
2384,"This is my first trip using Airbnb. I was a little nervous before the trip, and didn't know what to expect. I had a wonderful two days stay. The room is big, clean. The location is safe, quite, and convenient. The host is very kind and warm, make me feel like at home. The next morning I arrived, Chicago was cold and snowing, she drove me to my workshop location. after I checked out, she drove me to the hotel I booked for my next meeting. I could not expect any better experience than  this. I am very appreciated all the things she did for me. "

2384,"SÃ³lo puedo decir cosas buenas de Rebecca. La habitaciÃ³n estÃ¡ muy bien, con una cama grande y muy cÃ³moda. La casa estÃ¡ a 15 min andando del hospital University of Chicago, a 10 de la universidad y a 1 del tren que te deja en el centro de la ciudad. Rebecca es una persona muy acogedora, comparte su comida contigo, muchas veces te hace la cena y los fines de semana suele hacer desayuno. AdemÃ¡s, te ayuda en lo que necesites. A mÃ­, el dÃ­a que me recogiÃ³ en el metro me llevÃ³ a conocer donde estaba el hospital para que supiera orientarme al dÃ­a siguiente. La recomendarÃ­a a todo el mundo"
2384,"Rebecca was an absolutely wonderful host.

I was travelling to Chicago for a conference at the University of Chicago, and I had never been to Chicago before so I was a bit nervous about my trip. However, Rebecca helped to get me quickly acquainted with the city. On the day of my arrival, Rebecca picked me up from the bus stop and gave me a tour of the University of Chicago campus (which really is like a 10 - 15 minute walk from her apartment), Hyde Park (the neighbourhood) and the entire downtown area. In doing so, she also gave me pointers on which transit routes to take to get to the main Chicago attractions.

During the next 2 days of my stay, Rebecca made me feel extremely welcome and comfortable in her home. She made sure I had everything I needed. She even made breakfast and dinner for me, which really helped cut my expenses for food on my trip. Moreover, Rebecca respected my space and privacy during my stay.

On my last day, my flight left early in the morning and there were not many bus routes available during that time. Rebecca offered to drive me instead. This made my trip extremely convenient and less stressful, and I will always be grateful for her generosity.

All in all, Rebecca made my first experience with Airbnb a memorable one, and I recommend her apartment for anyone who is looking to stay near the University of Chicago."
2384,"Rebecca really tried to make it feel like home away from home, and went out of her way to help me get to where I needed to go.  When I arrived in O'Hare, she came to pick me up at the airport, and drove me all the way to Evanston (where I was going for the day).  Then, later in the day, I got on the wrong train going south and went right past the apartment, finally getting off 12 miles south.  Rebecca immediately drove, picked me up, and then had dinner ready back home!  She's a very kind and helpful lady, and wonderful to talk to, also - I learned a few things about Chicago from her!

The listing description is accurate - the room looks just as in the picture.  It's a two-bedroom apartment, and Rebecca lives in the other room.  There's also a bathroom, living room, kitchen, and dining room.  Rebecca keeps the kitchen stocked with some food if you want a quick snack or want to cook something, and there's also a small grocery shop 4 blocks away.  The apartment is a very short walk from University of Chicago, which makes it perfect for visiting academics.  It's also very close to the Lakefront trail, if you want to go for a run or walk.

Overall, I had a wonderful experience, and would love to stay with Rebecca again the next time I visit!"
2384,"Hi. i just return from Chicago and want to share my experience.
   Rebecca was so  nice and she gave me to feel in her home like my home. She came to the airport that is far from her flat and picked me from the airport. I stayed for 5 nightes and i felt very good and safety.
    The flat is clean and  comfortable.
 (Website hidden by Airbnb) am sure i will come again to Rebecca in the future.

2384,"Rebecca is a very charming and  nice personn, a super welcome, she was very helpful during all my stay. 
The accomodation is very quiet, clean and convenient when you want to go to the loop.
My stay  had been a very good moment thanks to Rebecca.
Thanks a lot :)"
2384,"A Great host. Rebecca was very helpful with everything. . She makes sure you have everything you need but gives you your space. The place is very cozy, well kept, and clean. 

Room is as perfect as it display here in images. Great location to visit McCormik Place by Metra. This apartment is in a great location on a nice street with a Safe neighbourhood. Kitchen is full of almost all grocery and she make me conferrable to use it.

As a person, Rebecca is very kind, friendly and always ready to help. She took time to explain everything is apartment. She provided some great information regarding streets, public transportation options and places that were of interest. She even come to drop me to o'hare airport at 6 in the morning.

I would definitely stay here again!

Thank you Rebecca!!"
2384,"My wife and I had a wonderful experience staying with Rebecca in Chicago. Prior to our trip, she kept in communication with us and offered tips and guidelines as far as where to park (free right outside her apartment), how to get around downtown (bus stop and train nearby), and places to visit/see. The home was very clean, quiet, private, and in a safe community very close to the University of Chicago and the Museum of Science and Industry (almost right across the street). Rebecca provided us a breakfast each morning while we were there and was very friendly. We spent most of our time in Chicago sightseeing and going to the three consecutive My Morning Jacket concerts at the Chicago Theatre (the main reason we came to town), so we weren't at her place all that much. However, having Rebecca's apartment to come home to for rest and relaxation and to regroup before heading out to see more of the city was vital for our trip being a success. This was our first experience using Airbnb, and it was fantastic!"
2384,"I stayed 10 days with Rebecca and had a most pleasant time. The apartment is part of a charming 100 year-old complex that surrounds a tranquil garden courtyard. Rebeccaâ€™s home is very comfortable and equipped with more conveniences than I needed. I found Rebecca a most generous host happy to fully share her apartment and to assist in any way possible. The apartment is part of the leafy suburb that surrounds the University of Chicago and benefits from both the constant security put in place for the students and the public transport that serves the campus. And last, but not least, Rebecca makes an excellent margarita."
2384,"Rebecca greeted me with a warm and welcoming smile.  She showed me  my room, the rest of the apartment and said to help myself  to anything I may to eat or drink.  She made me feel very much at home.   She  acquainted me with the neighborhood transportation and directions whenever needed.  "
2384,Rebecca was friendly and did everything to make me feel comfortable; she even interrupted her evening activity when I arrived at the flat early to let me in. The room and apartment were nice and clean and a well equipped kitchen made it a very pleasant stay!
2384,"One of the best places near the University of Chicago. The apartment was close to the campus, so I didnâ€™t have to take a bus or a cab to get there. The room was also clean and niceâ€”even better than my own room in Korea. There was a convenient steam iron, and the bed was really cozy. Above all, Rebecca is friendly and kind. She showed me the downtown of the city, and told me a lot of helpful pieces of information. I wonâ€™t forget it here."
2384,"The apartment and bedroom are spacious and clean. The location is very close to both bus and train options, and a short walk from the UChicago campus. Best of all, Rebecca was incredibly friendly - she took time to show me around the neighborhood, and I enjoyed chatting with her. Highly recommended."
2384,"Rebecca was a great host. Even though I was only in town briefly, she made me feel very welcome. Her apartment is absolutely gorgeous, clean, and convinient, and (importantly!) the bed was reallllly comfortable.

"
2384,Rebecca was super nice and a great host! Her apartment was super cute and the bed was fluffy and soft (which was great because I was so tired after walking around the city).
2384,Rebecca was an excellent host. Her apartment is located really close to UChicago. The apartment is very nice and clean. The bedroom is very comfortable. She knows the area very well and told me all of the spots to check out. I highly recommend staying with Rebecca. 
2384,"It was a great pleasure staying at RebeccaÂ´s and I can only recommend it. The room is pleasant and Rebecca made me feel right at home. She is a wonderful host, helpful, and lovely company too! The apartment is within walking distance of the lake, public transport, groceries, cafeÂ´s and of course the university. Thank you, Rebecca!"
2384,"Rebecca was the perfect host - she was flexible on the time of arrival and always gave great advice on what to do in Chicago. Perfect location for visits close to the University.
Everything was clean, and the bed was really comfortable. I will definitely book this place again when I return to Chicago."
2384,"I had a fantastic experience staying with Rebecca. The apartment is gorgeous - classic, spacious, beautifully appointed, and immaculately clean. I slept better in the guest bed than I do in my own at home. Everything you need is here - bathroom products, extra linens, even full access to the kitchen. The apartment is so close to campus I only had to wake up 20 minutes before my conference - and there were also good (and affordable) restaurants nearby for a late night dinner. 

Rebecca herself is a VERY cool lady. She was super welcoming and understanding when I forgot to check out (even though she had another guest coming). Then, when I had an hour to kill before my flight, she not only offered to drive me downtown, but ended up taking me sightseeing in Pilsen and dropping me off at the airport! I know she can't do that for every guest but it's a sign of how warm and generous she is and how much she wants guests to enjoy their stay. Thanks for everything Rebecca!"
2384,"Rebecca is a very welcoming and generous host. I was at her home for two weeks and her guest room was a very good, clean and great place for recovering after work or sightseeing. It is located nearby the university campus and therefore very convenient for research trips or conferences. Rebecca also picked me up and drove me to Oâ€™Hare â€“ which was really a nice and unexpected offer. I can really recommend staying at her place."
2384,It was such a cute space both outside (the entrance garden is amazing) and inside. I was impressed how nice and tidy Rebecca keeps her home. She is a warm-hearted person and showed me around the neighborhood when I first arrived; and you feel you have enough freedom and as comfortable as at home
2384,"I had an excellent experience at Rebecca's place during my stay. Not only was she very accommodating to my late arrival time, but she made me feel very welcome during my visit. Unfortunately I wasn't able to talk with her that much during my visit on account of a busy schedule, but I encourage anyone else who books her place to talk her, as I imagine she has a wealth of knowledge about the city! 

Also 10/10 points for the bed I slept in. I'm not sure if it was memory foam or what, but it was exceeding comfortable. "
2384,"Rebecca was the picture of an accomodating and understanding host. My flight was delayed due to weather issues in my city and as a result I wasn't able to make it to her before I went out on Halloween. She graciously let me in with a great attitude even though I didn't make it into the house until 3am! Rebecca's how is charming and inviting. The room looks EXACTLY as described and was so comfortable! I had a great sleep every night. Her home is close to the train station (just as advertised) and it made getting around very easy. She is also near the University of Chicago campus which is beautiful (in case you wanted to walk around).

Rebecca was helpful and willing to suggest great places to eat and even took the time to share breakfast with me the day I flew out! She provided yogurt, coffee and various treats to make me feel welcome and taken care of.

Not to mention her shower is dope lol. It has 6 showerheads! 

Staying with Rebecca was more than I could have asked for. A gracious and kind host, I would highly reccommend that you stay with her if you have the chance. She made me feel welcome and it was like staying with family (except she didn't pester me about when I'm getting married). :)"
2384,"My stay at Rebecca's place was great! Rebecca is a very nice person. She showed me the neighborhood the first evening when I arrived and made me feel like at my own home. Her apartment is very neat, cozy and calm. The building is very close to the University of Chicago, so is great for the University visitors. I would recommend staying here!"
2384,"The room was exactly as described/pictured and as I expected. It provided exactly what I needed, a place to sleep and get ready for the next day. I had my own keys so I could come and go as needed. Rebecca was a wonderful host and went above and beyond what I expected when she helped me with transportation to the airport on the last day of my stay."
2384,"Rebecca provided the full B&B experience! She went above and beyond what I would expect from a host. The room was bright and comfortable, I had everything I needed and much more, and the location was perfect for attending my conference at U of Chicago. She was friendly and fun to talk with and I hope to stay here again the next time I'm in town. This was my best airbnb experience so far, and would recommend Rebecca's house to anyone looking for a friendly home away from home! "
2384,"Rebecca went above and beyond what I expected, and is the definition of a perfect host. She was welcoming, kind, respectful of privacy, and fun to talk to. The room is spacious with an extremely comfortable bed and pillows (seriously). She provides everything you need, and is more than happy to share her food!"
2384,"This is my first try with AirBNB booking and I had great experience.  I was at UChicago to visit my son and the school.  It was just one block away from his dorm.  The location is prefect.  The room is as what described, clean and warm, big space in the private bedroom.  The host is a great lady, telling you anything you need to know and make you feel at home but certainly give you all space you need to be on your own.  You have freedom similar to you are at hotel and also you feel at home you can ask someone and chat with mutual topics.  I am highly recommending it to anyone who is interested in visiting UChicago.  In fact, I am talking to my wife on next trip to rent from the host. "
2384,"Rebecca is a very gracious host. A perfect, extremely safe place  to stay next to U of Chicago. A fantastic home away from home.
"
2384,"Rebecca is the definition of a perfect host. She arranged everything so I could be independent in her apartment but was happy to answer any questions. She even drove me to my event the last day since I had to leave for the airport right afterwards and otherwise would have had to drag my giant luggage through public transportation. Her apartment is clean, comfortable, and quite charming. I especially liked the canary yellow walls of the kitchen. If I ever need a room in Hyde Park in the future, this will be the first place I look."
2384,"Very nice, kind-hearted lady. She's been very helpful during my stay, providing tones of useful information. We talked a lot and she impressed me with her knowledge about hight-tech/Internet things !"
2384,It is a wonderful and comfortable place. I feel it as my home. Rebecca is very thoughtful and helpful. 
2384,I had an amazing stay with Rebecca! Her home is beautiful and she is so nice and easy to talk to. She even drove me to the airport at 5:30am because the bus wasn't running that early. Completely recommend this place. 
2384,"I had such a lovely time staying at Rebecca's place! As others have noted, this is the perfect option for anyone who needs to stay close to the university (10-15 minute walk to the centre of the campus - leaning toward 10), while also being very convenient for downtown. The listing is spot on, the room was equipped with everything I needed, and Rebecca made me feel welcome in the entire flat. I really cannot overstate what a warm and generous host she is - Rebecca, I really do hope we can meet again sometime and continue some of our conversations!"
2384,Rebecca is very kind and approachable!
2384,"I was on a 10 week visit to University of Chicago and had the fortune to stay at Rebecca's place the whole time. The room is comfortable. The location is convenient---close to both the university (one block away from some graduate student housing) and next to the metra station. This is a 10-15 minute to the center of the campus, and on the route of several university night shuttle lines. Moreover, Rebecca is an extremely considerate and generous host, and made me feel at home during my stay. I highly recommend Rebecca's place."
2384,"Rebecca is a wonderful host, very welcoming and accommodating.  The room is bigger than it appears in the photo, with a good sized closet, desk and bureau.  It's clean and very comfortable.  Her condo is lovely and quiet, with entrance through a courtyard.  I had a very enjoyable stay and highly recommend Rebecca's place."
2384,Excellent in every way!
2384,"Rebecca's apartment was great. Comfy, clean and as advertised. She even had some coffee and fresh fruit on hand in the morning. Altogether I was very satisfied with my stay."
2384,"Rebecca is truly one of the most hospitable people I've ever met, and her apartment is lovely - highly recommended."
2384,"I had a wonderful stay at Rebecca's place during a brief visit to the Univ. of Chicago. The apartment is conveniently located for the U of C campus and the metra train. The apartment is in a gorgeous pre-war building and has a lot of impeccable period features, which I just loved. The bedroom I stayed in was very spacious and comfortable and I slept very well. Rebecca is an extremely warm and generous host who made my stay easy and relaxing. She was very accommodating when my flight was delayed and she even did me the very generous favor of taking me to the airport when I was leaving. I would definitely stay at Rebecca's place again when I'm in Chicago next."
2384,"Rebecca has a lovely apartment that she keeps very tidy. She stocked the room with items that came in very handy since I was attending a wedding, like a magnifying mirror and garment steamer. She also provided much -appreciated breakfast items. The place is very walkable. I recommend it!"
2384,"Rebecca is an extremely generous host and fun to be around! We went out to lunch together several times, and she also helped me get around the city. Her place is clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. The location is surrounded by parks, next to the University of Chicago, walking distance from bookstores, cafes, and a beach. Getting to downtown Chicago and connecting to the L is about 25 minutes by way of the number 6 bus which picks up right across the street. (Note that the Metra train stop right by the apartment is not the CTA and is its own system.)
I stayed for three weeks, and it was a cozy place to crash after traveling around the city or a quiet place to spend the day working. The bed is extremely comfortable too.
I had a great time and would definitely stay here again!"
2384,"Everything was a clean as I could ask for, the bed was comfortable, and the bedroom was surprisingly cool on what must have been some of the hottest nights of the year.

Rebecca was pleasant and accommodating of my inconveniently-late arrival.  The apartment is a pleasant walk to the university, and there are a couple of coffee spots along the way.

All in all, exactly what I was hoping for!"
2384,"What a wonderful experience! Rebecca was the perfect host. Her apartment is lovely- v clean and homely. The facilities are great and Rebecca is very welcoming and helpful.
The apartment is also located next to a bus stop that will take you right into downtown Chicago and runs every 10mins.

I would highly recommend staying at Rebecca's and very much look forward to returning soon!! "
2384,"Rebecca is the most thoughtful Airbnb host. She has thought of everything you need from charging outlets and fast wifi to towels and a comfortable bed. Her home is super organized and clean. The apartment is perfectly located just a beautiful short walk to campus, next to the train, with ample street parking- and even a divvy bike rental station right in front.  I can't believe how easy it was to settle in and get my work done on campus and come home at night, feel right at home, and get a great sleep. I had never rented a shared apartment before on Airbnb, but because of Rebecca's thoughtfulness and amazing hospitality I had a wonderful experience in Hyde Park. I am very grateful to Rebecca and I know I'll stay with her again next time I'm in town. Thank you so much!"
2384,"Rebecca excels in all areas: welcome, communication, food, comfort, amenities, conversation, and location! I will definitely be back in the future. "
2384,"This is my second visit to Rebecca. I have a schedule dinner very late and cannot check in before 9pm. Rebecca was waiting for me until I safely arrived. Also, Rebecca was very nice to refund me money because I was going to change my schedule and would leave one day before my booking time. I will always rank Rebecca's home as my first choice in Chicago and I really take it as my home every time I visit. "
2384,"I was in town for a wedding at Rockefeller Chapel over on UC's campus and this location was too perfect. It was in walking distance but in heels, Uber was also an option and very cheap. Rebecca was awesome and so generous with her time and home. The room seemed bigger than it was in the photos (Hurray) and has a walk in closet with hanger and shelf space. There were also great extras like slippers, great pillows, museum and site seeing guides in the room. There are several parks in the area within walking distance as well as cafes, restaurants and shops and not just the ones frequented by the campus crowd. Rebecca was also great with giving directions to her place and communicating before I came into town. "
2384,"Rebecca is a gem in the Airbnb world. I was travelling to Chicago by myself for a weekend to go to a concert and found her place to be absolutely perfect for my needs. She was more than generous with her home and her time. She had a free evening and offered to drive me to the show and joined me for dinner and a good conversation. I have never had such a good time with a host. The first night I called my fiance after the concert and he asked how the show went and I said the show was fine, but my Airbnb host is AWESOME.  Rebecca has a beautiful home in a fantastic location in walking distance to places like the Robie House, Oriental Museum, Hyde Park, Museum of Science and Industry, as well as lovely cafes. The condo is right next door to the Metra that will take you into the city and multiple bus stops. My stay could not have been easier or more pleasant. As a single traveler Rebecca made me feel perfectly at home and I will not hesitate to stay here again if I come back to Chicago as a solo traveler. Her attentiveness and warm personality really set her apart. Thanks for the great stay!"
2384,"It was an amazing experience staying at Rebecca's place because she is such a warm-hearted host who is really caring and lots of fun to talk to. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was so clean! I also liked the fact that the pressure of the water was just perfect. Sometimes other airbnb houses have weak hot water pressure, but this place has very poweful water pressure. Also, she offers everything in her fridge! It was so convenient to tour the U of Chicago with a very walkable distance. She is really gentle, and knolwedgeable about the neighborhood and Chicago in general. I am definitely coming back if I get another chance to visit Chicago. Thank you Rebecca for the very pleasant experience!!"
2384,"Rebecca was a welcoming and wonderful host. The room and apartment were well
Prepared and she was generous with information and amenities. The room is large, the bed is comfortable with lots of pillows!"
2384,"A superb experience, and Rebecca is a delight. My flight was delayed but she was waiting at the entrance to greet me. Over the course of a week, my gracious hostess turned out to be a treasure trove of information on Hyde Park and Chicago and, soon enough, became my new best friend. She was considerate and kind, caring and yet professional and highly efficient. Her deep knowledge of everything Chicago, be it the university, museums, theater, restaurants, transportation, local architecture or history made my trip a breeze.  I am already planning a return trip.

The room was much larger than I had thought, bright and sunny with ample closet space, a desk, free WiFi and bookshelves. Comfy bed with a cozy down comforter, and I got fresh sheets mid-stay even though I said they weren't necessary. The apartment was beautiful, in  a drop dead gorgeous vintage courtyard building. The shared bathroom was spotlessly clean with plenty of fresh towels and a separate shelf space for guest toiletries.

Convenient as no other. I was right on the U of C campus here, blocks to law school, hospital and the Quads. Great location. Walked to everything. First day, I was tired following a sixteen-hour international flight but, voila, it turned out the university shuttle stopped next door and took me anywhere I wanted on campus. Metra Electric, the train, also stopped literally a block away and  whisked me downtown in twenty minutes. The bus, also nearby, too was a twenty minute ride. Get and go Divvy bikes, the best way to tool around Hyde Park, ere available for rental at the building's door! If you're an Uber person, Uber Share is five dollars to the city.

For exercise, I ran on the lakefront, which was a five-minute jog. Scenic city run, and free! The LA Fitness ten minutes away does three-day passes.

There are plenty of places to eat on nearby 57th Street, just two two blocks. I breakfasted daily at Cafe Salonica, a neighborhood diner and Hyde Park institution. For pizza, pasta and burgers I recommend Cafe Medici, a student hangout with huge portions. Gluten free choices at Medici. Both BYOB.  There is also a convenience store on the corner of 57th and Harper, about two blocks.

Pleasant, clean. comfortable. A home away from home. A true gem in the heart of Hyde Park. Six out of five stars!


"
2384,"Everything was exactly as advertised and better. The bed was so comfortable - the blankets, sheets, and towels were delightfully fresh. Plus the room was spacious. Great location for visitors to UofChicago, and getting into the city was easy. I liked having options - Metra or bus. Breakfast on Sunday and lovely conversation were the highlights. Rebecca is a fantastic host!"
2384,"Rebecca is an amazing host and was a wonderful introduction to both Airbnb and Chicago.  She was very welcoming, resourceful and kind.  Her home was in the perfect location for a job interview at the University of Chicago.  Her listing was extremely accurate.  She dropped me off at 2 touristy attractions which was so much more than I'd ever ask or expect. I will definitely stay with her again for any visit to Chicago and so should you! "
2384,"Rebecca is an amazing host. The apartment is on the second floor overlooking an enclosed courtyard. The bedroom is spacious with a luxurious bed, desk, chest of drawers and walk in wardrobe. Two USB chargers were provided on the desk and by he bed. There is also a television but I did not watch it as in the evenings I sat with Rebecca in her lounge and we chatted over supper and wine. We watched a little television together including the Cubs first game of the World Series which would have been better if they had not lost 6-0.

I was in Chicago for a conference at McCormick Place and the Metra train which goes there directly is barely two minutes walk door to door. On Sunday there was a large gap in the train service and Rebecca very kindly drove me to the centre which she did again on the last day to save me carrying my luggage on and off the train. She also demonstrated her seamstress skills meaning my rucksack. She made arrangements for me to get in as my flight arrived quite late in Chicago and coincided with her being out. There are also good washing facilities and the Permapress setting on the tumble dryer meant I did not need to iron anything.

Rebecca is a wonderful lady who provides a great place to stay and a generous welcome into her home.
"
2384,"I had a amazing stay with Rebecca. She is very welcoming and friendly. The location is great, close to public transport and a short walk to the UChicago campus. "
2384,"This is my second airbnb stay at Rebecca's place. Like before, this experience was great too! House is nice, cozy, clean and calm. But most importantly, Rebecca is a very pleasant and kind person, I very much enjoy talking to her. She also gave me a drive when I was leaving, which was very nice of her. I would especially recommend the place to everyone who visits the University of Chicago for family or work-related reasons."
2384,"Spent 10 days at Rebecca's flat. Everything was perfect. Rebecca is a wonderful host, always ready to help, give a ride... Room is big, has everything one needs. A minute walk from bus to downtown or Metra station. A few minutes walk to Hyde Park and the University of Chicago (where I went to work with colleagues). I will highly recommend the place to anybody going to Hyde Park!"
2384,"Calling all AirBnB'ers looking to stay in Hyde Park / near the University of Chicago! Do you want to stay in a beautiful, spacious, cozy, clean room and apartment? Do you want a knowledgeable, easy-going, conversational host? Look no further.  

I stayed with Rebecca for an interview at the University of Chicago, and I can't recommend her enough. On the first day, I expressed that I did not know much about Hyde Park and had never seen many of the sights of Chicago, and she kindly drove me around, pointing out the sights of the city. Her knowledge of Chicago is unparalleled, so regardless of if you're staying in Hyde Park or venturing beyond the neighborhood, she can point you to all of the best places. Her apartment is 5-10 minutes walking distance from the University of Chicago, just as advertised. The room itself was pristine, and it shows that she puts the utmost thought in accommodating her guests - comfortable and clean sheets, blankets, and pillows; city guides; USB chargers; a garment steamer, slippers, etc. Additionally, Rebecca provided towels and soap for my stay, as well as space in the bathroom to keep my toiletries. And on top of all of the great conversation and hospitality during my visit, she also prepared breakfast for us twice during my stay! 

Best AirBnB I've ever stayed in; could not recommend her enough!"
2384,"Rebecca's place is fantastic for a quiet residential stay walking distance to the University of Chicago or a short Uber ride downtown along beautiful Lake Shore Drive.   I enjoyed University events, and had a great time visiting downtown.  Her neighborhood is very safe for walking, and Uber availability is outstanding.  The train station is less than a block away as well.  The accommodations are clean and spacious.  Rebecca's hospitality was outstanding, and this was my best AirBnB experience to-date."
2384,"Rebecca is a Chicago local and she knows the neighborhood and the city of Chicago very well. She provided me with information with regard to public transportation and how to get around in the Hyde Park neighborhood, which was very helpful. Her apartment is very clean and very well organized. You will find everything you need there. It is within walking distance to the campus of the University of Chicago and therefore perfect for everyone who has to do business at the University. The room is spacious and very nice. You have your own closet and everything you need. Rebecca is very kind and helpful. She made me feel very welcome in her home. I would definitely recommend her place to everyone and I would stay there again!
"
2384,Rebecca is an amazing host! Accommodations are clean and bed is super comfy. Rebecca is so nice and offers food and drinks at no charge. She make me breakfast too which was wonderful and unexpected. I hope to stay here next time I'm in town
2384,The bed is too comfortable. Rebecca is probably the best host I've had.
2384,"Rebecca was a warm, gracious, and welcoming host! Her apartment was very clean, warm and cozy, and I felt like I was at home immediately. She made every effort to help you become comfortable. She was generous with her time, and breakfast. I would gladly return!!"
2384,"I highly recommend Rebecca's place when staying in Hyde Park. It is located very close to the campus of the University of Chicago, as well as the Metra line for access to downtown and the broader city / metro area. Rebecca was an amazing and friendly host, and the room was extremely comfortable and spacious. Highly recommended! "
2384,"Rebecca was an extraordinarily considerate and generous host. The space is ample and agreeable, highly recommendable if you need to be in the area."
2384,"Rebecca was a tremendous host and really helped me feel at home. She really made me feel welcome, especially in a new city. I would especially recommend her for those checking out U Chicago; her place is literally next to the school. "
2384,Best airbnb host ever!The apartment is clean and cozy and only 10min walk to campus. Rebecca provided everything I could ever ask for. So happy that I chose this apartment.
2384,This was my first time in Chicago. I went to attend a UChicago event. Rebecca was very kind and a great host. The room was spacious and clean. Her place is a few blocks from UChicago. Very convenient . 
2384,"Rebecca is a great host. The room is very clean and very nice, and especially the bed is very comfortable. Location is also very good to visit University of Chicago. I will definitely stay here again when I come back to Hyde Park."
2384,"My stay at Rebecca's was more than perfect, simply the best host ever. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything . You got a friend in Brazil ."
2384,"The room (and the whole house) is very clean and quiet. You can find almost everything you need in the house. It's about 2 minutes walk to the the public transit (bus stop and train station). I walked in the neighborhood around midnight and it looked safe to me.   

Rebecca is the best host ever. She made sure I have a good time in his house and in Chicago. She was so kind to show me the city and also looked up for the details of activities I wanted to do. I couldn't imagine a better host. I wish I could stay there for more than 2 days."
2384,"The location is good. The closeness of the metro station to the apartment makes it easy to access downtown Chicago. It was easy going daily to my conference at the McCormick's place which is about 10 minutes away by metro and to return either through the same means or by cab. Rebecca readily answered any question I had related to my stay and getting around Chicago. She welcomed me in person to her home, showed round the house and arranged for a taxi to take  me on the first day to the conference venue. I had access to all parts of the house and she ensured my privacy by not being in the way. The cleanliness and order maintained in her home is highly commendable.  Thank you Rebecca for making my stay in Chicago wonderful. Rufina"
2384,"I had a fabulous stay. The place is just as described: clean room,  beautiful apartment, strategically located close to public transit, walking distance from UChicago, Whole Foods, and several cafes. Rebecca is a great host, and I am looking forward to staying with her should I visit Hyde Park again."
2384,Good host
2384,I stayed with Rebecca for 2 and a half weeks. The apartment is charming and very comfortable. Perfect if you are doing anything at the university of Chicago. very close to the number 6 bus for getting in and out of the city. Rebecca is a very generous host. 
2384,"Great location if you're visiting UChicago. The place is clean and comfortable, almost everything you need is ready. Rebecca is a nice and helpful host."
2384,"Rebecca is a great host! The room was nice, the bed was comfortable and the bath room clean. Rebecca made me feel welcome and helped me to get around in Chicago. She even invited me for a deep-dish pizza. The connection to get downtown is convenient, it takes about 25 minutes with the #6 bus. I would definitely stay at Rebecca's place again. "
2384,"The flat is large and extremely clean, placed in a great location for anything university-related. The bedroom also is large and clean. Rebecca is fantastic - very friendly, open to questions, generous. The only problem was the internet connection, which was jumpy for my whole stay."
2384,"I stayed 4 days with Rebecca and had a great time. Rebecca is a wonderful host and I am very satisfied to stay in her apartment. She always made me feel welcome and took care of me when I need some help. I could use everything I need to stay, such as bathroom towels, closet, Wi-Fi, etc. In the kitchen, I could cook anytime, but I was in trouble to make dinner, so she kindly cooked pasta for me. I appreciate her kindness. Her apartment is very organised, relaxing, and close to the University of Chicago. There were security guards around so I felt safe to commute the university. If you have any business at the university of Chicago, I strongly recommend her apartment. In addition, her apartment is very close to the number 6 bus stop. It was very easy to go to the downtown city. 
"
2384,"Loved staying with Rebecca. She was kind enough to take me on a ride around the neighborhood on my first day, showing me all the best spots to check out. The room was large and comfortable. The apartment was nice, functional, and comfortable. The apartment building and grounds were especially beautiful! Highly recommend staying with Rebecca. "
2384,"This was the best Airbnb experience I've had! Rebecca gave me a tour of the neighborhood, made breakfast, and had really clear instructions for how to do everything in the apartment. The room is nice and clean, and the location is a block from a bus that gets you directly to downtown. "
2384,"Rebecca's place is really clean, comfortable and not far away from downtown Chicago. Rebecca was a great host: she drove me into town to help orientate me and offered me advice on what to see and how to get around. She was very generous with food and drinks and I wouldn't hesitate about staying with her again if I was ever in the area."
2384,"If I could rate higher than 5 stars I would definitely do that.  Rebecca is really awesome.  She has the magic to make you feel you are just coming to visit an old friend (if 'family' is too much).  I enjoyed the entire 3-day (2-night) stay and would definitely recommend if you are a single traveler visiting UChicago area. 

*** Below are some details in relatively objective descriptions =) ***
1. I have an early arrival flight (8 AM) and late departure flight (9 PM), which translates into early check-in and late check-out time.  Rebecca checked with me on my schedules beforehand and immediately suggested the offers.
2. I planned to visit Northwestern University on Friday.  Rebecca offered me ride both ways.  Same thing happens when I went for a) a dinner gathering with my friends that night, b) a wedding the next morning, and c) a friend's place on the departure day.  Rebecca said that she planned to go out in similar direction, yet I feel she adjusted her routine schedule for the ride offer. PS: Rebecca treated me a Groupon-ed lunch after we arrived Northwestern Univ. area.  Very delicious.  
3. The house is located in a quiet and cute neighborhood.  Pretty safe as well (but I did not try to hang around too late by myself).  The only sound I remember hearing was metro (?)- around 6 AM ish in the morning.  That being said, I would still rank it as quiet.  The room has great ventilation and plenty of storage including a small walk-in(able) closet (a small cubicle). Everything is clean and neat (this applies to the entire house).
4.  A wide range of quick meal selection: cereal (4 types at least); pasta (4-5 different shapes) and sauces (4-ish), snacks, etc.  
5.  Rebecca responds to emails and texts quickly... enjoyable conversations anytime...
6.  Pretty sure there are other things I forgot.

Thanks Rebecca!"
2384,I came to Chicago for Lollapalooza and wanted to stay a little further away from the city center because I thought it would be too pricey. Rebecca's home is beautiful and the accommodations were very comfortable. Just a 20â€“30 minute bus ride (2/6/28 bus stop is two minutes' walk from her building) to Grant Park/downtown. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting Chicago!
2384,"The room was comfortable, the neighborhood/location was solid, and the host was fantastic and a great person to converse with."
2384,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Rebecca's place, she was very friendly and thoughtful. The first night I arrived it was quite late by the time I reached her place. When I mentioned I hadn't had dinner yet, Rebecca was kind enough to cook me a meal, complete with salad and white wine! It was a very thoughtful thing to do, and something I very much appreciated. 

Her place was spotlessly clean and the room itself was very large, which was quite convenient. I found the building itself to be very quiet during the evening, making it ideal for getting a good night's sleep. 

Both Rebecca's place and the building and grounds are very photogenic - would highly recommend her place to future travelers. 10 out of 10! Many thanks for a great stay."
2384,"Rebecca is a super host. It was a pleasure being at her place and meeting her. Her stories were insightful and if you are looking to get a grasp of what Chicago is, I would highly recommend staying at Rebecca's. The location is great, close to University of Chicago, and you can easily connect to the city center by public transport. The room is big and cozy with a comfortable bed. Next time I'm in Chicago, that's where I'll be."
2384,"It was great staying at Rebecca's place during this weekend. Her airBnB is the cleanest, coziest and kindest one I've ever had so far. I would love to recommend this place to any other people who want to stay at Chicago near Hyde Park. I hope I could stay here again next time!"
2384,"Rebecca's apartment is steps away from the University of Chicago, Metra station and bus stop to downtown so her place is conveniently located.
The apartment has an open view, the room is spacious and the bed is very comfortable so you may not want to get out of bed in the morning. The apartment provides all kitchen utensils and toiletries, and Rebecca is more than happy to share all her food and drinks in the kitchen. This makes the stay very convenient. 
Rebecca is a wonderful host. She loves to share all travel tips and anything she knows about Chicago. She is very nice, friendly and is always eager to help. She wants to make sure that the guest has a comfortable stay. She is the best host I've met ever. Thank you so much Rebecca!"
2384,Rebecca est une hÃ´te formidable.
2384,"Rebecca was, by far, the best host I've had. It was a pleasure staying with her in her darling home! Absolutely recommend her place if you're staying in the Hyde Park area!"
2384,"Rebecca is a wonderful host. Everything about my stay was marked by her care and attention to detail in a very stylish apartment, with the comfiest bed I've ever slept in! I didn't manage one of her breakfast omelettes but they looked really delicious. Well located for getting in and out of the city, with great bus and train connections. The building is a very handsome block of apartments, very close to the University."
2384,"Rebecca is a very nice, caring and courteous host. And one feels like home in her flat from the first minute on. 
The flat is located in a quiet and beautiful area of Chicago with some shops and the Museum of Science and Industry in direct proximity. A few steps away there are also a Metro station (15 min to downtown) and a bus stop (30 min to downtown).
The room is very huge, nicely furnished and everything is very clean and tidy. All in all a perfect place to relax.
Furthermore, it's very nice and interesting to talk with Rebecca and learn more about the life and the neighbourhoods in Chicago."
2384,Rebecca was welcoming and accommodating.  Dropped me off a few times whe. She was going out in car.  Location is very good if going to uchicago.   Her place is clean and spacious and bed is comfortable.  Only note is the shower is old style body spray at chest level so anyone tall wild have a challenge to wash hair.    Also note for luggage  it is walkup building (only 2 flights).   I am likely to stay again when I am back visiting my uchicago student.
2384,"As always, staying at Rebecca's place is the best airbnb experience! Thanks Rebecca!"
2384,"Rebecca's condominium in Hyde Park is a perfect place to stay in Chicago, whether you are looking to stay in the area or explore other parts of the city. It is extremely easy to get to from Chicago Midway airport, and is right on a major train line. It is within walking distance to the University of Chicago and the Medical Center, convenient for those spending time there. Rebecca went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was comfortable and fun. She had all the necessary amenities and was willing to do whatever was necessary to ensure that I was well taken care of. Upon arrival, she took me on a tour of the area, sharing local history and personal accounts. I LOVED Chicago, and a large part of that was due to my time spent with Rebecca!"
2384,"Rebecca is a great host. I felt very comfortable and at ease during the stay. The location is just adjoining the University of Chicago. 
Rebecca  is always ready to help . She helped me to go around for the basic needs and dropped me at the airport as well. She also took me to the neighbourhood for the halloween day, which was a first of kind for me. 
Thank you Rebecca."
2384,"I echo just what others have said. Staying here was wonderful. Rebecca made me feel so at home and every need was catered for. Thank you so much :) Rebecca is also a mine of information on all things art, university, shopping etc. And will provide any guidance you ask for. 

Top favourite things about Rebeccaâ€™s place: lovely clean sunny apartment, big bedroom with immensely comfy bed and all linen and towels of high quality.  Relaxed and welcoming!! I would add that as I was staying here primarily for access to the university, Rebeccaâ€™s place suited me perfectly and I loved ambling down leafy avenues to college or to the local Wholefoods and various cafes. All within 15 minutes walk. When I wanted to go into town, I jumped onto very regular buses which are 2 mins away or the Metra which is on the doorstep. It couldnâ€™t have been easier."
2384,"I would describe RebeccaÂ´s place as  the greatest Airbnb I have stayed . 
The neiborhood is near the University of Chicago . Quiet and near the Train station it was everything I hoped for . The room was spacious , clean and  very very confortable.  And of course Rebecca was an amazing host!  She offered me a ride uptown when it was on her way  and made sure my stay was amazing. 
I would trully recommend this place to anyone"
2384,Great location and apartment. Very thoughtful touches and Rebecca was very nice. Overall wonderful!
2384,"Rebecca is probably the best airbnb host I've stayed with. The whole house is beautiful and spotless. The room is spacious with a very comfortable bed, and plenty of storage. The location is great for anyone working at UChicago or anywhere in the Hyde Park area. The listing is accurate and Rebecca responds quickly to any questions you may have.

Rebecca is an extremely generous and thoughtful host, made me feel at home, and went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable. After a long day at work, I really enjoyed sharing a meal and chatting with her. Thank you for those amazing red velvet cupcakes! She also gave me a ride to the airport at 5:30 am (FIVE THIRTY AM!!!), when she really did not have to! I cannot thank her enough for making my stay so pleasurable!

I would highly recommend her place!"
2384,Rebecca is a welcoming and gracious host. Her apartment is right next to the university so is super handy for students and visiting faculty. The train to downtown is less than a block away as is the closest bus stop. Rebecca's apartment building dates from the 1920's so has tons of charm. The guest room is spacious and the bed is super comfy. The apartment has WiFi and there is a TV in the guest room. I recommend Rebecca's apartment without reservation. It's a gem.
2384,"Staying with Rebecca was a pure pleasure. The apartment was spacious and comfortable, as was the bed. She had all the amenities, so I didn't need the toiletries I had brought with me. I was there for a week long class, and she even drove me to the seminary on a particularly cold morning, as well as brought me my Kindle that I left at her place after I checked out. The only downside was that the wifi was too slow to stream tv shows, which also a good thing anyway. I highly recommend staying with Rebecca, and I will stay here the next time I'm in Chicago alone!"
2384,"Rebecca is a superb host and the apartment is perfect for visiting the University of Chicago. The room is spacious, well equipped (e.g. numerous power outlets, walk in closet, desk, etc) and Rebecca is extremely welcoming and courteous. I definitely recommend!"
2384,"Rebecca is the absolute best host ever!
The house is lovely, considerably more spacious than I thought judging by the photos. Everything is spotless and very nicely decorated.
Rebecca is lovely, always ready to give you a hand and help you get oriented in the city. Also, I had a great time just sitting in the couch and having conversations with Rebecca. She's so open and relaxed!
Would come back without thinking twice."
2384,"Rebecca, made my stay wonderful and she is a great host.  Her home is beautiful, warm and bright.  Perfect location in Hyde Park, U of C easy access to CTA bus lines and METRA trains to downtown.  I look forward to my next stay!"
2384,"Iâ€™ve spent a whole month in Rebeccaâ€™s and I can only say good words about Rebecca and her house. Rebecca is a really nice host, very kind and she worries about your welfare.
The house is very clean and the bedroom is so roomy!
Itâ€™s a really convenient place if you are planning to go to University or the University hospital, because there is a free shuttle which stops just in the front door. Besides, you can go walking to the university. Thought it is quite far from the downtown you can go there by train (metra) or bus, both of their stops are 1 minute walking from the house. 
I highly recommend it if you are going to the University. If you are planning only to visit the Downtown, probably it is a bit far, however it takes  less than 30 minutes to reach it by metra or bus."
2384,"This is the perfect location if you need to be near UChicago. I stayed here while I spent a week with my son who is studying on an exchange year from King's College, London . The accommodation and welcome from the Host Rebecca was wonderful. The kitchen was well stocked and I was encouraged to help myself. Rebecca spent time with me to ensure I knew about local facilities, and trains and buses etc. She offered lifts and shared meals with me. The room was perfectly equipped, and comfortable. A real home from home."
2384,"Rebecca is a wonderful host - generous, thoughtful, unobtrusive, and fun to talk to.   The bed is comfortable, the room is spacious and well furnished.
The location was perfect for me - steps from the Metra and right on the edge of the university campus.  Will definitely stay here next time I'm in Hyde Park!"
2384,"Rebecca is an extremely thoughtful host. She even drove me where I needed to go, twice - once before 6am so that I could catch my flight. The room is clean and spacious. The apartment is charming and located right next to U. Chicago, so the location is great. Highly recommend, and I would definitely stay again!"
2384,"I stayed with Rebecca to attend a conference at U of C. The apartment is beautifully located right next to campus, a train station, and a bus stop, so getting around was very easy. Rebecca herself was also available and offered to drive me to the train station upon departure. The apartment was clean and bright. The bed was very comfortable, and Rebecca is very generous with amenities!

While the apartment was great, I think the best thing about staying at Rebecca's place was being able to spend time with Rebecca herself. I've never met a more hospitable person! She was so welcoming, a great conversationalist, and even invited me to a play and some late night deep dish. She really turned my (kind of) boring conference into a little Chicago mini-break! If you get the chance to spend time at Rebecca's place, do it! What a wonderful experience!"
2384,"Rebecca is the best Airbnb host I have met. I will strongly recommend her to my friends, and will try to book her place in the future if I visit Chicago :)"
2384,"It is the best Airbnb I ever had. Very clean and cozy. It's the first time I visit the Chicago, and Rebecca really helped me a lot. The location is also very convenient, just walk-in distance to University of Chicago, and also very close to the grocery stores. Would definitely stay here again!"
2384,This is such a wonderful place.  I enjoyed staying there so much.  The location next to the University is so convenient and beautiful.    It is really lovely.  Rebecca is a great!  I highly recommend it.
2384,"Rebecca's was my first AirBnB stay. it was wonderful.  My room  was spotless, and comfortable with plenty of drawer and hanger space. She also provided a small work area and wifi access. The room was bright  and  quiet inspite of being near a Metra station. Travel to and from downtown was easy especially with the maps and flyers that were suppllied. Rebecca thought of everything. Rebecca knows her city and was happy to share.  Staying with her was a pleasure, and if other hosts and stays are as hospitable and  committeed  as Rebecca, I will be a committed AirBnB guest"
2384,"Rebecca is an outstanding host, who is so fun and great to talk to, hang out with and stay with! Her house is very nice and in a great neightbourhood and location next to UChicago. It is perfectly clean and equipped with all necessary amenities.  When she found out that I have an extra half day in Chicago with no plans, she offered to go out and show me around and visit a nice museum and festival together! I absolutely enjoyed my stay in Chicago more because of her, and look forward to stay with her next time I visit!"
2384,This is A FABULOUS LOCATION if you are doing anything in Hyde Park / University of Chicago. Rebecca is a superior host; lots of great touches. Place was spotlessly clean and extremely comfortable. I couldn't have been happier. I would definitely stay here again.
2384,"Wonderful airbeb, very clean and comfortable. Close to downtown via train and bus. Very close to McCormick Center.
Rebecca is amazing and lovely host. Never met a so kind and and friendly person. 
Best airbeb ever."
2384,"I'm attending a conference at U Chicago and this is my second time staying at Rebecca's place. The location is superb is you're visiting the neighborhood. Everything is smooth from booking to check-out. The place is super clean, tidy and makes me really comfortable. Rebecca is a great host, patient and thoughtful, you can't go wrong with her."
2384,"Rebecca's place in Hyde Park is exactly as advertised, and what you see in the photos is exactly what you see when you walk into her lovely, classic, Chicago walk-up building.

The guest room is clean, spacious, and comfortable, with large windows and amenities such as ample shelf and drawer space, a desk with chair plus another armchair in the room, and iron and ironing board. (There may be more, but this is what I'm aware of.)

Rebecca keeps plenty of snacks and breakfast supplies on hand, including fresh and healthy foods. Morning coffee is a cinch. (That's the most important thing for me!) A variety of teas also is on hand.

It's easy to come and go, and I never had a problem finding parking. I was amazed how little sound comes over from the nearby rail line, and I kept my window open at night.

Best of all, Rebecca is a congenial and attentive host. I had delightful conversations with her, once at breakfast time and several times at the end of the day.  I would recommend this listing very highly. I'm only sorry I won't be returning to Hyde Park again anytime soon!"
2384,"Host was very kind, communication was direct and easy.  The apartment is really lovely, lots of charm, clean, and the host shared food from a well stocked kitchen.  I highly recommend this place, couldnâ€™t have been better."
2384,"Rebecca is an A++++ host. When I arrived she showed me around the neighbourhood and I really enjoyed spending time with her! The place itself is well styled and very clean and comfortable. I felt very safe at Rebeccaâ€™s and welcome in her home. The facilities were just what I needed for a week long conference. She is right next to the train station, which is super convenient! "
2384,Rebecca is the kindest host Iâ€™ve ever met through Airbnb.  She knows so much about the city and was very responsive with communication. Check-in and check-out were easy. The apartment was clean and had everything I needed. A delightful stay for one person or a couple. Lyft or Uber worked great into the city and felt safe.  There is a long stretch of space through the park walking about 20 min to some places to eat and shops (loved Fabianaâ€™s Bakery) which was great during the day (took Lyft at night).  The Gage was fun downtown for good food and cocktails. I loved staying here!
2384,"I strongly recommend to book this room! I stayed for 3 weeks and had a great time. Rebecca makes you feel at home, it felt like really living there, and is more then helpful. She welcomed me with a beautiful salad and showed me parts of the city. We went out for Barbecue together, and had great discussions on the evening. Easily one of the best Airbnbs I ever stayed at! Rebecca, thank you for your warm hospitality and I hope to see you again someday!"
2384,"Rebecca is an absolutely fabulous host with a kind and beautiful soul. She made my stay in Hyde Park so memorable and special. 
Iâ€™m so thankful I had the opportunity to stay at her wonderful apartment. It was clean, comfortable, and she went out of her way to be accommodating. I canâ€™t recommend her enough. Absolutely wonderful."
2384,Rebecca is a wonderful host and a lovely person. And I really enjoyed my stay at her charming place this weekend. Ditto to all of the positive reviews that are posted here! 
2384,"Rebecca was simply amazing! On my very first day she took me around the city, 'cause I told her it was my first time, and even took me to a famous chicken place because according to her I had to try it. (Delicious by the way) She was very attentive and answered all my questions and always made me feel like I was at home.  I am very lucky I found this place! â™¥ "
2384,"this place is perfect for a weekend getaway,  really enjoyed my stay in this comfortable house
"
2384,"By far, the best host i've ever met on Airbnb is Rebecca. Once you step into her dashingly clean apartment, you know you met a friend who opened her home to you. She welcomes you personally and shows you around. It has a big bed that could fit 2 people easily, perfect wi-fi and amenities. She lets you raid her fridge whenever you're hungry and everyday offers you clean towels. The location is great. Itâ€™s right next to the 59th Street Metra Station, so access to and from Chicago is very easy. 10/10."
2384,"Rebeccaâ€™s apartment is perfectly located on the border of Hyde Park, right between the bus stop nÂ°6 (2mns) and the Metra train station (2mns) to go downtown. Walking, you find yourselves at 5mns from the University Quadrangles, and on the other side, at 5-10 mns from the Lakefront trail. The room is bright, quiet, ultra-clean. Rebecca changes the bed sheets every week end and the bathroom towels almost each other day. She is a great host, very kind, thoughtful and helpful, with such a sense of hospitality that she brought me by car the first day to Marianoâ€™s do my shopping, and called me an Uber to the airport, since my cell phone was out of function. Rebecca made my stay in Chicago much more comfortable than I could expect. Many thanks for that!"
2384,"I highly recommend staying at Rebeccaâ€™s place!

Perfect for anyone with business at UChicagoâ€”youâ€™re practically on campus. And easy access to the cityâ€”no more than two minutes walking to public transit and a quick, easy trip downtown. 

Rebecca is an incredibly gracious host. I could not have asked for a better introduction to Chicago."
2384,I had a wonderful stay with Rebecca. She is a gracious host and her apartment is cozy and well kept. The location is just a few minutes walk from campus and a few good restaurants.
2384,"Rebecca is a warm and gracious hostess. Her home is charming and conveniently located near the UChicago campus and just feet away from a Metra stop. I enjoyed a few conversations with Rebecca about movies and about living in the Hyde Park community, and in Chicago more broadly. Her home was filled with art and books and more almonds than you have ever seen . It was also extremely clean and fresh-smelling. I highly recommend a stay with Rebecca, especially for prospective UChicago students â€” you will gain great insight into the community. Thanks, Rebecca!"
2384,You can expect a great host with a clean and welcoming place.
2384,"Rebecca goes above and beyond what I ever would expect from an Airbnb host. I had read this about her -- and it turned out to be true. First, her place is immaculate, attractive, warm, and perfectly located. Second, she was an incredibly generous host with her time and warm energy. I got the sense that she truly enjoys hosting. From the glass of wine she offered me on the first night to the conversation at the breakfast table the next morning to the -- wait for it! -- invitation to join her for a show at the Goodman Theater, she was a hostess with the mostest. Endless thanks to Rebecca for making this visitor feel welcome!"
2384,"Super location if you are visiting UChicago.  Clean, comfortable, friendly, with lots of extras."
2384,Terrific hospitality!
4505,"Great place for a great rate next to the CTA! Garage parking is hard to find in the city! Craig and Kathleen could not have been more hospitable. Craig helped us carry in our bags, and he even helped us navigate our way downtown. Delicious pastries, orange juice, and coffee in the morning. The apartment has wonderful hard wood floors and beautiful photography done by Craig. We are definitely coming back to Chicago and staying here!"
4505,"Great place to stay at and a great rate!  The train to the city wasn't more than 10 min and it was right next to the house.  Craig was a great host and made us feel like we were at our own house.  The breakfast was also great with pastries, oj, coffee, and juice.  Best part was the record player!  Would def stay again if we head back to Chicago anytime soon."
4505,"My boyfriend and I stayed here three nights and we loved it. The location is AMAZING. Not only is it right across from the CTA, but it is in a great neighborhood. We mostly interacted with Craig and he couldn't have been more helpful. The place is adorable, the bed was super comfy and the breakfast food and coffee was greatly appreciated. We will definitely stay here again. "
4505," My friend and I stayed 5 nights at the apartment. The only place  I would ever want to stay when visiting . Incredibly comfortable, good neighborhood, conveniently located across the street from the Pink Line CTA into the city. Craig was the best host and went above and beyond to  make us comfortable.  And I would never forget how surprised I was to come back to the apartment after a long day to find birthday cake and a present with a special card made by Craig on the  doorstep.  He also helped with our bags, made himself available if we needed anything. Staying there gave us all the privacy we needed but with the security of not being alone in an unfamiliar city.  Craig and Kathleen  are great that are very generous and caring. I highly recommend staying with Craig & Kathleen if you are in Chicago as having an entire apartment with everything you could possibly want. We even saved money by cooking at the apartment when ever we were there. There's even a garage to park your car. I will be staying with them again very soon if it's not booked. We loved this place so and we're actually quite sad to leave. "
4505,I'd say 4  3/4 Stars.  I spent 4 nights.  They are very attentive and helpful.  The kitchen has all the stuff you usually need.  Bed was comfy.  Butter and Aaron (the dog and cat) are fun to be around but playing with them is your option.
4505,"Great place to stay for a couple. Very comfortable, good neighborhood, conveniently located across the street from the Pink Line CTA into the city. Craig was a great host. Helped with our bags, made himself available if we needed anything, but also gave us all the privacy we needed. I highly recommend staying with Craig & Kathleen if you are in Chicago as having an entire apartment with all the fixings at this price is hard to come by. There's even a garage to park your car. I will be staying with them again very soon.  "
4505,"Great place, even better people. The apartment has everything you could need, and is in walking distance to anything you might. They're very personable and intelligent, and brilliant artists. It's a literal stone's throw from the Pink Line, and about a 12 minute ride to get downtown. Wouldn't stay any other place on a trip to Chicago; 5 stars, highly reccomended, tell all your friends etc.

Also, their pets are as cool as they are."
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were great!  Really helpful and knowledgeable about the area.  The apartment is HUGE, right across from the Pink Line... so easy to get downtown.  We had a great time and the breakfast foods were fantastic.  Craig's photography decorating the apartment is a bonus!"
4505,"Great place! Good location across from the Pink Line, so easy to get to the loop. The apartment is really cool (Craig's photography is amazing; and Craig himself is very nice and helpful), very clean, and has everything you need. We would stay here again. "
4505,It was great experience. He is a very generous host. His house is next door to the pink line Cta line. His place is huge and he has a big refrigerator to store food you may buy to eat during your trip. I enjoyed my stay.
4505,We loved it here.  It was so close to the Pink line and had so much history.  Craig was wonderful and we made some new hairy friends.  We would stay here again!
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were very warm, welcoming, and incredibly helpful.  The apartment was very clean and spacious.  Access to the rail is literally a stone's throw from their home making travel to the loop, Oak Park, etc. super convenient.  Butter and Aaron were incredibly sweet...we could not have asked for anything more!"
4505,"Craig & Kathleen are amazing hosts. The location is incredibly convenient, just across from a Pink Line CTA stop, so getting into the Loop is no problem.  The apartment is clean, spacious, well-stocked, and adorned with many of Craig's fantastic prints.  Highly recommended!"
4505,"The apartment was spacious and very comfortable, but definitely loud, being between a CTA line, a bus terminal, and a rail line.  We found it hard to sleep the first night but adjusted quickly.  Craig and Kathleen were very nice and accommodating.  The location is a ways out of the downtown but, as others have said, it's right next to the station so it's easy enough to get into the main part of the city.  It was certainly interesting to see more of Chicago off the beaten path.  Would certainly recommend for other travelers looking for a unique and fun experience."
4505,"Best deal in town... Craig, Kathleen, Aaron and Butter were great. The apartment is huge, clean and full of charm and the pink line is seriously right out the front door. You are in the city so of course there was some noise but our 10 month old baby slept with no problems so you should too! Having the garage was perfect b/c we could park it and forget it. Our advice stay here."
4505,"The apartment was clean, spacious and comfortable; the location is great being next to the pink line. There's a grocery store across the street to stock up on breakfast items, which we did after finishing the bagels and cream cheese Craig had bought for us. We parked the car in the garage so parking was not an issue. You can easily accommodate a large family and everyone will be comfortable. We'll definitely stay here again and will recommend to our adventurous friends. "
4505,"we had a lovely stay, and definitely plan to stay again! outside your conversation will be interrupted by trains, but its worth it for the easy travel. safe, comfortable, an excellent deal."
4505,My boyfriend and I had a great stay in Craig and Kathleen's apartment.  It is located right next to the pink line which made it easy to get anywhere in Chicago.  The apartment itself was spacious and very clean.  We would definitely stay there again.
4505,"Great time! We had the entire first floor, which you walk into a foyer, then into a spacious kitchen with an oven, micro, fridge, and all essentials to fix meals.  The hot water is plentiful and HOT.  The living area is equally spacious along with an open back bedroom, a smaller bedroom off the master, and another bedroom (work in progress, but clean) off the living area.  Enjoyed the quick ride on the pink line into downtown... never had a car or needed one."
4505,"We would both highly recommend this great apartment!! Located in an ethnic, bustling, energetic neighborhood~ so be prepared for the normal hustle and bustle of a noisy neighborhood.  Ear plugs a must for light sleepers.  But the convenience of the pink line and the great hosts totally made up for the noise!!  The breakfast food Craig provided was great and we were able to have a leisurely breakfast and coffee before heading downtown for a long day of sight-seeing..  We will definately stay here again if we visit Chicago again!!  "
4505,"This was our first airbnb experience, and I highly doubt we'll ever have a better one. Craig and Kathleen made us feel right at home; the apartment was perfect. We had fruit, orange juice, and bagels for breakfast provided by Craig. If you've never been to Chicago, Craig can pretty much tell you how to get anywhere and the house is less than a block away from the pink line. It was the best vacation of all time thanks to these two."
4505,"Huge apartment (bigger than my own home!) that is really cosy and livable. Craig and Kathleen are friendly and super-welcoming, Craig even walked me to the local supermarket. The apartment literally across the road from the pink line California station, and the area is cool. Noisy at night, definitely, with the trains and a rattly heating system, but I slept fine on the comfy bed. Bagels with cream cheese and orange juice for breakfast was just right!"
4505,"We spent the week of our Fall Break at Craig & Kathleen's Great Location with our daughters, ages 12 and 8... it was super-nice to have so much space for the family and not be crammed into a single hotel room. We slept late in the mornings, visited museums in the afternoon, and ate dinners in different ethnic neighborhoods, including some great Mexican right there in Little Village. As posted by many others, having the train station right on the block is awesome, but we also didn't have any problems calling for cabs either. Definitely bring your earplugs if you're a light sleeper! Craig was super-attentive and helpful... we'd definitely stay here again."
4505,Staying at Craig and Kathleen's was like having our very own apartment in Chicago.  The apartment is complete with a full kitchen and LOTS of space.  The proximity to the Pink Line was superb and made our daily commute simple and fast.  The hospitality was great and Craig made himself available should we need him.  We plan to visit again one day with a group of friends...because there are TWO more bedrooms!  
4505,"Staying at Craig's and Kathleen's was a true pleasure.  There were ten (10) of us up for a weekend workshop, and having the home allowed us to bond and work and relax together in a way no ordinary hotel could provide.  The beds were comfortable and roomy, there was the most delicious and wonderful fruit for breakfast and snacking, and the place was extremely clean.  We were steps away (a block or two) from a fantastic supermarket, there were plenty of local restaurants, and the el train is not 100 paces away.  Super convenient.  Craig was warm, welcoming, and extremely accommodating.  Next time, we'll cook in the kitchen!  Thank you for such a lovely, special, and convenient place to stay.  We could not have asked for better hosts.  A delight."
4505,"Two of us spent 3 days at Craig and Kathleen's place. We both thoroughly enjoyed the city and having a place like this to stay at made it so much more enjoyable. The ""L"" right across the street! The location, the huge apartment, fantastic and friendly hosts, everything was great. I cant wait to come back and stay here again! Thank you!"
4505,"We had a great experience. The place is huge and comfortable. We didn't have the opportunity to meet Kathleen, but Craig's a great guy and a talented photographer. The other reviews say it all. The one thing I can add is that we were able to get a fast, reliable public wifi connection from the apartment. No idea if it's always available but it was great while we were there."
4505,"I had a fantastic stay at Craig and Kathleen's place as a base to discover Chicago.  The huge place, the super convenient location and the colorful Little Village neighborhood all added up to a comfortable, hassle-free stay.  But best of all was having a connection with Craig and Kathleen who were creative, warm, interesting with a genuine passion for life and experiences.  You won't forget your stay!  Thanks so much.  "
4505,We enjoyed Craig and Kathleen's apartment we changed our holiday itinerary to come back a second time. We are travelling with 4 children and the apartment is exceptionally spacious and comfortable.  It was a quick trip on the Pink Line to the city centre. Craig and Kathleen are terrific hosts and went out of their way to make our visits enjoyable. 
4505,"It is a lovely place to stay! Next door is the train station, you'll be in downtown Chicago in 15 minutes. Unfortunately Craig and Kathleen we're only at home the last of our nights, but we had a great stay nonetheless!"
4505,"Excellent time in Chicago and Craig & Kathleen were fantastic in making sure everything was fine for us during out stay.  Convenient location to downtown Chicago if you're either driving or taking public transportation.  It was great having a garage to park our car in and not have to worry about cleaning off snow during our stay.  We'll definitely be back on a return trip to Chicago!  

Thanks!"
4505,"We had an great time at Craig and Kathleens.  It's a huge place, it was very clean, and they had some breakfast items such as pastries and bagels.  It was our first time using AirBnB and it was definitely a win."
4505,"Great neighborhood, good photography, warm people, cold city."
4505,"First time to Chicago, Craig & Kathleen's place was pretty perfect. Craig gave great directions and was very helpful, providing us with maps, guides and info about the city. The apt was spacious and very comfortable. We would definitely stay there again when we come back! The ""Pink Line"" (train) is right at their doorstep and it saved us alot of money! You have to eat at the Cocula Mexican Restaurant which is just blocks away."
4505,"Me and my friends had a wonderful time in Craig and Kathleen's house; it's a huge and clean apartment and evrything inside works good! They are very kind person and Craig is also a very good photographer! We enjoined our vacation in Chicago, that is a beautiful city! "
4505,"Craig and Kathleen are great hosts - funny, kind, thoughtful, non-intrusive, sane-appearing, responsible, with a highly useful neighborhood map on the fridge.  Between us, we have almost as much gray hair as Craig does, so even if you're not-young, you'll probably have a great time.  As described, it's an artist-type place, so if you want a hotel, stay at a hotel (we like hotels, too).  Great location for public transportation; trains did not interfere with sleep; chorizo with eggs available in the neighborhood.  We wanted a long weekend in Chicago without having to see the relatives, and this was a perfect fit.   Next time, maybe we'll get to meet Kathleen in person.       "
4505,"The place was perfect for us (five students) during our stay in Chicago. There was plenty of room for privacy and communal gatherings, and Craig was very helpful with showing us how to get around, getting us metro cards in advance, and coping with our garage mishaps. The place is literally right next to the train, which was perfect, and as others have mentioned, no problem with the noise at night. Lots of fruit for breakfast made us feel extra welcome. Definitely recommended for low-key groups looking for a low-key place to stay."
4505,"First time using airbnb & being in Chicago, Craig & Kathleen's place was very easy to find. Prior to arrival, Craig & Kathleen were very helpful in giving directions to their place and tips on using public transportation. Literally steps away from the Pink Line. Craig & Kathleen are great hosts! Craig helped me get my bags inside (from the gate to the kitchen of the apartment). Craig's map of the area made grocery shopping and finding local places to eat way easy. Upon on arrival, Craig and I even rode the bikes. Way fun! I hadn't ridden a bike in over a year. The apartment is spacious, clean, and pleasant on the eyes (Craig's photography decorates the walls, and the apartment is neatly organized). Bed is comfortable. Sounds of trains didn't bother either of us. All kitchen utilities worked great. Heater very convenient during cold night. And although my boyfriend and I didn't get a chance to formally meet Kathleen, hopefully the next time I'm in Chicago we can meet her. Overall, my boyfriend and I had a GREAT experience."
4505,"Probably because of the photos of the apartment and prior positive reviews, I felt comfortable inviting a coworker to stay and see this different part of Chicago. Weâ€™d just finished a weeklong conference in a big hotel on East Wacker and wanted a change of pace. The apartment is huge and allowed each of us our individual privacy. It was a better experience than I could have planned. The map of the neighborhood on the â€˜fridge was a real eye-opener to what is within walking distance: Peteâ€™s Fresh Market [on par with Whole Foods], several Mexican restaurants including Casa de Samuel [an award winner from (Website hidden by Airbnb) and three thrift stores. The easy access to the Pink Lineâ€™s California station is unbeatable.  

If youâ€™ve ever enjoyed peeking at â€œThis Old Houseâ€ on PBS, this is the place for you. The house was built in 1893 and its hardwood floors are well-restored and do not creak. Some of the other projects are in progress, but not obtrusive. Craig is very low key, efficient and a great host. I didnâ€™t meet the new puppy, Aaron or Kathleen but felt a really cool energy while staying at the house. I look forward to my next Airbnb stay. "
4505,"This was a great experience. The apartment is literally across the street from the California Ave Pink line stop on the El, so it was very convenient to get around. The trains weren't even that loud-- we slept fine. The apartment is huge and could have accommodated way more people than the two of us. We didn't even go in the two bedrooms available. The bed was comfy, too. There is also free Internet! Craig entertained us for an evening and told us about his travels and photography. It was a great experience and we will definitely suggest it to anyone traveling to Chicago. Thanks again!"
4505,"This place had many pluses, and few minuses.

Pluses: nice hosts, large older apartment - tall ceilings, pretty woodwork, lots of good light.  It is very close to El, about 20 minutes to loop. Also we could get on a public wifi network.  The place was reasonably  priced.

Minuses: we were there on Memorial day weekend which was very hot, and the place has no a/c, although the host is considering it for the summer. It was also noisy at night, and two of the rooms had bright  lights from outside shining in.  I brought good earplugs and a sleep mask which helped.

We would stay there again, but maybe not during hot summer months"
4505,"I could not have hoped for a better Air BNB rental. And here's why: 

- The 3 bedroom space is immaculate and is stocked with extra towels, blankets, soap, etc. The bed(s) were extremely comfortable and provided for a good night's sleep. The ceiling fan(s) allowed air flow and helped maintain a perfect temperature. The kitchen is equipped with a stove/fridge/glasses/everything else, and while I didn't put it to use this trip, I will for in future visits to  S. California Ave. With windows throughout the place is bright  and just a wonderful place to come back to after a long day in the city. 

- As mentioned by everyone else, the proximity to the train is amazing. I walked out of the station ready to start down the street scanning for addresses, when I realized, ""Holy cow, it really is across the street. Those reviews weren't an exaggeration!"" 15 minutes to The Loop. Awesome. Oh, and the noise at night, is not bothersome in the least.

- Craig is a great guy to spend a few hours with. He graciously let me follow him around on the less traveled path of Chicago. Three hours later, I found myself back in downtown amongst the other tourists, with a feeling of superiority after seeing sights they couldn't imagine. Abandoned rail road tracks, industrial outer limits, less appreciated sculpture gardens, an empty field with the most unbelievable views of the skyline. Craig is the man! And I highly suggest seeking out his company during your stay. 

Craig and Kathleen, thank you so much for your hospitality. Chicago was beautiful and I hope to return in the near future!"
4505,"whirlwind stop in Chicago, but great first airbnb experience. apt is exactly as described. bed extremely comfy. no issues with train noise. air conditioner was just installed and worked a treat! light does come in but coming home late each night after pounding the pavement, we didn't really notice and passed out within minutes. Craig's photography was inspiring and slightly (Website hidden by Airbnb) own paled in comparison! Overall, great experience."
4505,"Both Craig and Kathleen were very accommodating and helpful throughout our stay. We unfortunately arrived the night of the big storm, power was out until 2:30 am! Kathleen even offered her cell phone for the night since mine was almost out of juice with nowhere to plug it in. Very convenient, next to the ""L"". Their new dog is awesome! Definitely would recommend. "
4505,"craig and kathleen's downstairs apartment was a wonderful base for our chicago explorations. bright, lovely, and well-appointed. we wanted to take their dog home with us--what a sweetheart! 

they left us food and coffee for our breakfasts in the apartment, and there were lots of maps and guides available in the house in case we needed a little help. of course, craig himself was the best resource, and often pointed us to interesting places and had conversations with us about what we planned to do that day. the train couldn't have been more convenient, and the new a/c unit worked like a charm (though we only had to run it one day, since the rest of the time the weather was perfectly cool.)

craig's photography made us even more thankful that we were staying in a home rather than a hotel--it was such a unique perspective on the city we were diving into every day.

i highly recommend craig and kathleen's place to anyone wanting an affordable, individual stay. thanks so much guys!"
4505,"Craig was a great host.  He had little goodies in the fridge, like OJ, a ton of fruit and bagels and cream cheese.  It was a very spacious apartment and Craig's great photography was displayed throughout.  (We even bought a print of one of his photos.)

The location is RIGHT next to the ""El Train"" and about 20 minute ride into downtown.  There are some great Mexican restaurants off the 18th St stop (3 stops away)  (We recommend Nuevo Leon.)

The neighborhood itself is quiet and residential.  Not much to do around there, but sometimes it's nice to be off the beaten path.

Mr. Sanchez (their 8 months old puppy) loves to chase their cat. And you can play badminton in their backyard if that floats your boat.

They also recently got an AC, so the heat was not an issue."
4505,"We are the family with the 7 year old twins that Craig generously only charged for one child during our stay (I think he said that together they added up to be one 14 year old :) ).  Whoever decided that it was a negative strike for him to kindly ""decline"" our first request for four people and have us re-submit it for three people is out of bounds.  Our stay was great, we loved the apartment and all of us enjoyed spending some mornings in the yard with Craig and Mr. Sanchez, and Aaron.  It was also a pleasure to meet Kathleen on her way to work one day.  The access to the train was awesome and we never had to wait long on the platform either.  I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay!!  Thanks Craig and Kathleen!!! "
4505,"I had a brief stay with Craig and Kathleen, but the apartment was brilliant. Great location to get into the loop on the El train, it's literally across the street from the California pink line station. The apartment is really roomy and breakfast was left in the fridge for me to munch on when i got up too!

Would definitely recommend a stay with Craig & Kathleen"
4505,"My husband, brother, two friends and I were in town for the Pitchfork Music Festival this July and were looking for an affordable, nice, unique Chicago experience.  We found the perfect place with Craig & Kathleen.  We found the unit to be exactly as advertised - roomy, comfortable, convenient, well-decorated, and cool (both in temperature and vibe).  There were even breakfast treats and fruit waiting for us when we arrived.  Craig and Kathleen were extremely nice and had great tips for us throughout the weekend.  All-in-all, we had a great time and I can't recommend staying here enough. 

If/when I return to Chicago, I'll definitely be checking in to see if I can stay here."
4505,"  Craig is the best!  The house was conveniently located, clean and very spacious for all of us; Craig is a charming and affable guy and a talented photographer to boot- the house is tastefully decorated with his great images of the city and its people- he even helped us get our van squeezed into his garage. Not only that, when I left my bag out on the curb (containing ll of my charts, laptop and finance books!) he called me right away and waited at the house while we drove back through traffic to pick it up. Highly recommended and I will be staying there again on future tour stops through Chicago!"
4505,"Aaa+++
Thank you for being so nice with us!!!
Everything was awesome!!!  The apartment was great!  Across the CTA station.  
Definitely, next year we will come back!!!
Say hello to Mister Sanchez!

With love,
The whole gang!!"
4505,"Our stay with Craig and Kathleen is what travelling is about. Their kindness and friendship made our trip to Chicago memorable. The instructions on how to get from the Amtrak to their house was precise and when we arrived with time still left on  our metro train ticket, Craig took us back into the city to buy a travel pass to save us money and inconvenience while we were in Chicago. Then he escorted us to a bar on the 96th storey of one of the town's skyscrapers where for the price of a drink you can have the view that the other punters are paying for. Then into Blues Brothers territory for a meal at the famous Billy Goat tavern and a walk along the river with a low key commentary on some of the highlights. Most appreciated.
Their home is wonderful. Old Chicago being lovingly restored - a work of art in progress. Our rooms (plural!) three of them with polished floors refrigerator stocked with food , spotlessly clean and the wonderfully appealing sounds of Chicago around you when you bed down for the night. A trip to the museum courtesy of Kathleen and being taken to an authentic Mexican restaurant by this delightful couple capped off an experience which we will ever remember with fondnes.
We just hope that we  can have them as our guests in our Tasmanian wilderness home. Five star rating.
Barry and Pamela Hopcroft"
4505,"Such a wonderful stay with Craig and Kathleen. They were very friendly, their house had a very convenient location, and after the L Train stops running it's only a $15 cab ride from downtown. They helped us find things around the city, and the stay was very comfortable. We're glad they had air conditioning, and we would stay there again. "
4505,Craig was our host - and he is just wonderful.  The apartment itself is spacious and full of light.  The CTA stop is literally right next to the apartment (and provides a great opportunity for trainspotting also from the front porch).  My only regret is that we didn't have more time!  The kitchen - although we didn't get a chance to use it - is definitely fully functioning and spotless.  A great place in Chicago!
4505,"Great people, great place, good value. The location is great -- within spitting distance of the pink metro line and 15-minute ride downtown (the downside is that you can hear the rumble of trains and traffic -- but that would be the case pretty much anywhere in centralish Chicago). Nice apartment with Craig's nice photography on the walls. We had difficulty at first finding Craig to let us into the place (don't depend on him checking for text messages or answering his cell phone!), but after that inauspicious start (for which he apologised profusely) things were great. Craig was a great host, going out of his way to accommodate us and make us feel at home -- e.g. even taking us to the metro station to explain how to buy tickets, helping us park the car in his garage, and even washing some of our dishes (way beyond the call of duty!). Nice people, nice young dog (Chavez), didn't really have a chance to meet the Obama-supporting cat.     "
4505,"There isnâ€™t a negative thing I could say about our stay at C&Kâ€™s place. We were able to connect with Craig way before we got there to make sure we knew where they were and when we could be there. Craig was super helpful with directions and recommendations. Their place was spotless and really, really enjoyable to stay. It was such a relief to have a great place to come back to after nights of exploring the town. Craig even treated us with bagels, milk, and fruit! Their place is really easy to find and Mr Sanchez and Aaron are great ambassadors/pets. Craig & Kathleen even helped us rush out of their place on our way to Union Station! Thanks again! "
4505,"Apartment was huge, clean, and well stocked. Craig not only provided us with a plethora of breakfast foods in the fridge (and OJ, of course) he also had two extra CTA passes on hand so we could get started right away. Craig helped us with our bags, and was very available to us had we needed anything throughout our trip. Genuinely kind people, so glad to have met you."
4505,"This was my first air b&b experience and it was a good one.Craigs directions to his house was great and very helpful and made life less complicated.He was there to meet and greet,The house was Awesome and having whole of down stairs to myself was great come and go as you plse.He had also done some shopping,gave me a tour of the placeand provided me with a map and great train (Website hidden by Airbnb) guarding transport the line is just outside great at night time.I didnt see alot of Kathleen but when i did again very nice to talk with.Craig was also awesome when it came to game day(baseball) told me what train to catch and when i should be (Website hidden by Airbnb) my recommendation is use air b&b and yes these guys are highly recommended by me.So thankyou Craig And Kathleen much appreciated.And there dog fantastic."
4505,"A incredibly convenient location for staying outside the center of Chicago, as the CTA train station is literally across the street, and frequent trais take you into heart of Chicago in twenty minutes.
Some train noise but did not bother us at all.  
Apartment is spacious and comfortable, even if a bit rough around the edges.  Heater was great when needed -- warmed up the place fast.
Wireless internet access worked fine for me each morning.
Craig is a helpful and friendly host, giving great info and advice when asked, but remaining unobtrusive when we didn't need anything.  And the fruit bowl, bagels, cream cheese, OJ, coffee and milk were a very welcome and pleasant surprise on arrival after our long trek from California.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Would stay here again when we come to Chicago."
4505,"We had a warm welcome from Craig. Everything was perfect.The house is very pleasant and we feel like home. It is well located. One exception : the appartment is very noizy, even if we knew it before. (Metro and train, next to the appartment - ). Remember to buy earing plugs if you want to sleep well, that works well !! But except that, it will be with great pleasure that we will return to Craig and Kathleeen's home."
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were wonderful hosts who made our Chicago marathon weekend quite memorable.  

Craig was nice enough to be our guide around the city on marathon day and always provided helpful hints on food and transportation.  

The house is in a great location for getting on the (Website hidden by Airbnb) is literally across the street from the train station.  Just a short trip (20 minutes or so) to downtown.  The noise of the trains didn't seem to bother anyone, as it wasn't too loud or disturbing.  The neighborhood around the home is quite diverse and even though the houses/buildings near the home aren't the prettiest scenery, the personal touches that Craig and Kathleeen create within the apartment make it very worth the stay.

We fit 6 (three couples) comfortably in three different rooms and they were nice enough to leave fruit and coffee for us to enjoy during our stay.  Craig and Kathleen made our marathon weekend easy and stress free.  They are great hosts and are special people to be around.  Stay here!  We sure will if we get back to Chicago."
4505,"We would definitely recommend staying here! Unfortunately we only needed to stay for one night, but we would have loved to have stayed longer. The apartment is very spacious and airy. It has a wonderful location- the train station is literally on your doorstep which is wonderful for getting into downtown. Craig met us upon our arrival and was incredibly friendly and helpful. An excellent choice."
4505,"It was a joy meeting Craig and his very nice dog, Mr Sanchez. The stay was especially nice with the breakfast items and Craig's photos adorning the walls. The convenience to McCormick Convention was perfect for our needs."
4505,"Spacious place. Gracious hosts.  The place is a bit rough, but its very clean and would be perfect for a group.  Craig and Kathleen were lovely and helpful. Another super AirBnB experience. "
4505,"We were a party of 7 and had a great visit in Chicago. As previously reported, the train in convenient and Craig is a helpful host. Thanks Craig and Kathleen!!!!!"
4505,"We had a wonderful time! Craig & Kathleen were very accommodating and went out of their way to provide us with lots of wares for us to cook a big meal :) Great location right next to the L stop, though be prepared for the clackatty clack of trains overnight if you're not used to urban background sounds. It didn't bother me, but others found earplugs to be very helpful. The house is quite lovely, a little chilly in the winter months, though. Ver short walk to a nice big The pets are adorable, all around great time! Thanks, Craig & Kathleen!"
4505,Craig was hospitable and helpful with tips about getting around Chicago. The old house is funky but comfortable. Thanks. 
4505,"Great house, clean and comfortable. Lots of room to hangout, nice comfy bed. Perfect position for accessing the train the noise of which never bothered us at night. If staying in winter best to turn heating off at night as it can be noisy and there is plenty of bedding to keep you warm.
We only got to see Craig on our arrival and departure due to us being out allot. He is very friendly and easy going and supplied us with all the info we needed to get around. 
Would highly recommend Craig & Kathleens place."
4505,"Great location to jump on the Pink Line of the L.  Convenient to navigate around the city. 
Great space - lots of room and well furnished. 
Our hosts were gracious and friendly.  They were helpful in navigating the city and set up wonderful accommodations. 

We felt welcome to come and go and enjoyed our stay.  "
4505,"This is hands-down the best place to stay in Chicago.  Not just for the gorgeous apartment with high ceilings, beautiful wood floors, and the super-comfortable furnishings...but when I stayed there, I felt like I gained friends.  I was only able to talk with Craig for the first couple of days as he had to meet his lovely wife Kathleen in Tokyo, but he was so gracious and friendly and funny and helpful.  I was fortunate enough to be able to attend an art opening Craig had with his amazing photography on the first night I arrived.  He introduced me to friends, and one of his friends even gave me a tour of the Art Institute Museum.  He even made sure I had people to count on if I needed anything at all while he was gone.  

You really do feel like you're at home in this place.  But this home is better than mine :D.  So this was a swank upgrade for a great price.  The location is Perfect!!  If you want to experience Chicago first hand, ride the trains...you have no excuse because the Pink Line can get you to downtown or to another train to go elsewhere in the city in less time than you could get a cab or drive your car.  It is right across the street from the house.  I jumped on everyday!  Craig can tell you anything you need to know, and he had a great transit map.  I originally had no idea where I wanted to go in the city, but I discovered so many wonderful places riding the train.  

I have never been so grateful.  Coming here was truly the best experience I've ever had.  I plan on coming back regularly, so although I am encouraging everyone to stay here, I am also letting everyone know, I want dibs on this place!  :D.  

Thank you, thank you, thank you to Craig, Kathleen, Annie, Jordan, and Kenny...you all helped make my time there awesome.  I will be back very soon <3.  Also, I love you Mr. Sanchez and Aaron, be good :D"
4505,"What a fabulous visit! We would stay here again in a heartbeat. The space is beautiful, and our hosts were wonderful. The location is terrific as well. Hope we see you again!"
4505,"Craig was incredibly friendly and helpful, and met us at a different time than we first thought we'd be there. They had put together a great stack of visitors guides for everything in the city and we found a ton of unique ideas, had an amazing 48 hours. It was loud in the night with the train so close, but it was still a good stay.  Thank you!"
4505,"Great place to stay, plenty of room for myself and traveling companions.  Right next to the CTA train, which was a huge bonus.  Clean place with plenty of towels & linens, the bagels, coffee and tea are a nice touch.  It was one of my traveling companions birthdays and the hosts provided a birthday cake, which was a very sweet gesture.  I would recommend if you need a great price with plenty of room.  "
4505,"We enjoyed the artsy, city vibe of the apartment, and were accomodated in every way by Craig and Kathleen.  Craig checked in with us to make sure our stay was going well. We had a longer stay than most guests, and we would gladly stay here again.  We also enjoyed daily visits from pets Aaron and Sanchez, all things that made us feel at home.  We did have a problem with connecting to the internet, which was a borrowed connection, and as business travelers this was a necessity."
4505,"We had a great stay at the big house, even though it was only for a few nights. Craig welcomed us like family (so did mr Sanchez). the house was definitely big enough, and the train is literally across the road that takes you into downtown in about 20 minutes. Found a great Mexican restaurant up the street which Craig points out on a map he has drawn up for his guests of all the local attractions/necessities. Craig is the perfect host and the place is great, the only thing I must mention is the noise. It is situated in-between two train lines, so it can get quite loud at night. Other than that I highly recommend staying at the big house. Thanks Craig."
4505,"All the good things said about Craig and Kathleen's place are true. I would add that if you are not an animal lover, don't let that put you off. I'm not and I'm glad I took the chance. The family pets are amazingly well-behaved, i.e. they leave you alone though no doubt they'd respond if you're the type to fuss over animals.

However, I would agree with comments that have others have made regarding two points. 
First, the trains 'are' loud at night - I say this having arrived after spending two nights 'on' a train. The freight trains are noisy. Ear-plugs recommended. 
Second, the wifi is taken from a local public facility, it is not provided by Craig & Kathleen. During my stay I didn't find the connection reliable - there was none at all one day and after it re-appeared I had to log in for every new web site or every 5-10 minutes, which is pretty limiting."
4505,We had a great stay!  
4505,"Craig was a fantastic host and their apartment was perfect for us. So much space and the L train just across the street. He left enough fruit, bagels and coffee to keep us breakfasted all week which was great. He was on hand for some excellent recommendations. We would wholeheartedly recommend staying here and will hopefully be back to this great city!"
4505,"The seven of us had a great time over a long weekend thanks in large part to Craig and Kathleen. An awesome renovated home in a funky neighbourhood (so much good Mexican food around) that's seconds away from the El train. Craig gave great suggestions for places to check out around town, hooked us up with fresh fruit and bagels, and all around made our visit one we'll never forget. Can't recommend it enough for large parties."
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were extremely welcoming and generous with their time and knowledge of the area. The flat is right across from the overground train which makes it a convenient and affordable base for exploring Chicago if you are making day trips and coming back at reasonable hours. Very quick to the centre of town, about 20 minutes. Plus additional time if you are travelling on elsewhere. My friends and I were visiting for a wedding, and stayed out late most nights. Taxis back were easy and affordable enough when split three ways. This was a light and comfortable flat, nicely furnished, clean, and very roomy for the three of us. It was even stocked with a bountiful heap of fruit and bagels for breakfast.

Choosing to stay here largely depends on what you think you'll be doing and how many of you there are. If you're staying out late in the city and rushing about, particularly if on your own, somewhere closer to the centre might be preferable. It's difficult, for instance, to come back to nap! You should be realistic about this. Also, I wouldn't feel inclined to stray too far and explore the neighbourhood after nightfall. But if you want more space and what seemed a more authentic slice of Chicago - just taking the pink line train gives you an interesting and different feel for the city - it's a great choice. On our last night, Craig and Kathleen invited us to have beers in their garden. The neighbours kids playing next door, a warm and pleasant evening, funny stories from Craig and Kathleen, their pet dog Mr Sanchez doing loops of the yard, it definitely felt as though we were seeing a part of Chicago we otherwise would have missed!"
4505,"Craig and Kathleen are fantastic hosts.

They've fixed up the space to be comfortable, clean, and cool. Most surprising was how restful it is! 

Breakfast was fresh fruit, coffee and bagels. All the prep is DIY, which I frankly prefer.

It's literally right across the street from the California station on the Pink Line, no more than 15 minutes from the Loop.

The neighborhood is diverse and blue collar - lots of families walking together in the evenings.

Looking forward to staying here again!"
4505,"Great place to stay - comfortable, relaxing and convenient. Yes the place is right next to the train station but to be honest, we were still able to get a good sleep.  No Internet as noted by others but we organized 3G access for ourselves."
4505,"We had a wonderful four-night stay. It really felt like home away from home with Mr. Sanchez  greeting us as we came and went and Aaron making a now and then appearance--  and  our own key to the whole first floor. Craig and Kathleen are  interesting, personable people who seem to really enjoy sharing their  home with people from all over.  We enjoyed sharing some time with them the first evening we arrived â€“ great stories all the way around.  They were helpful in all ways without being at all intrusive.   The homeâ€™s ceilings are high and the main bedroom, living room, and kitchen are quite spacious and light. Bed was very comfortable.  We felt like we were staying in a gallery with Craigâ€™s photos of Chicago on all  the walls. David said that Craig paid attention to the little details that mean a lot to him - like night stands/tables on both sides of the bed, a box of tissues and a roll of paper towels, and plenty of hooks in the bathroom and places for toiletries.  Kitchen well-equipped even though we were not cooking.  The breakfast Craig provided for us to help ourselves to  in our kitchen  - bagels and cream cheese, juice and lots of fresh fruit â€“ was most appreciated, so we could start our day right there and then head to the CTA across the street to go wherever we planned for the day.   We were told about the noise of the trains, and we slept through the night without being  at all disturbed by them.   We like trains, so their sounds were welcomed when we were awake.  We also enjoyed the neighborhood and would have liked more time to explore it.  Next time we will definitely visit the National Museum of Mexican Art, largest Latino museum in the country and FREE always, and hope to stay with Craig and Kathleen again.    "
4505,Craig and Kathleen were great hosts. They got us 2 bags of bagels and fresh fruit for our stay. Everything was clean and fresh. Craig even brought out a fourth mattress for us to use. The location is right next to the L train and only 20 minutes from the Loop. I highly recommend them. I just hope they aren't booked up the next time I go to Chicago.
4505,Wonderful 3 night stay at Craig&Kathleenâ€˜'s Place with a party of 8. Cozy rooms decorated by Craig's impressive photos. Hope to stay longer!
4505,"Craig & Kathleen were more than accomodating, interesting people, casual, and very nice.  Craig actually brought the keys and garage door opener to us before even checking in!  I think there was crack in the complimentary bagels and cream cheese- because I have been thinking about them every since.  The apartment is tidy, clean, and spacious.  If you are looking for the 4 Seasons- this isn't for you.  If you are looking for a unique experience with some amazing photography, cool peeps, and an edgy neighborhood- this sounds like your style.  Their puppy, Mr. Sanchez and their cute cat will bring you smiles when they greet you at the gate."
4505,"Rolled into Chicago on a sweltering, dog-breath July evening; blood red moon creeping up over the cityscape through a humid haze. A few highway twists, construction turns and some words as hot as the night air later, I found myself at my haven away from home for the weekend. The building itself showed a character not unlike the city; aged by a life well lived, but maintained and inviting you to come in and join the fun. The space is cavernous as compared to other lodgings, easily and comfortably accommodating a car full of gypsies, beatniks, vagabonds, tourists or travelers. All are invited who want to experience the city. The roll of the Pink Line train just outside the door lets you know that youâ€™re never more than a ride away from the pulsing centers of culture and commerce to be found about town and your hosts will let you know where to find what you seek.  

Whatever kind of Chicago you come searching for, they know it personally and probably had dinner and drinks with it last week, if not last night. You might have been there even, or only dreamed it. No greater proponents for the city have I ever met, nor for any city for that matter. Theyâ€™ve traveled the world, but return to Chicago and preach its virtues from the lake shore to the suburbs. They known just where and how to engage your sensory curiosities and leave you with an indelible impression of the city that you will take from then on. Or they will leave you to find the city on your own terms, offering the guidance of seasoned veterans of Chicago life for you to take and do with what you will. 

If youâ€™re after mild amusements and your stories to reflect typical travelogue tropes, this is a fine place for which to set up and ship out from on your way to museums and tours. If you seek fun and frivolity, a desire to cut loose and party the night, this is your spot to venture out from and crash back to. If you've the artistâ€™s eye or the writerâ€™s mind you will find characters and stories here. A better spot, more gracious hosts and ease of access to the cities curious splendors, I've not known. Buy the ticket, take the ride.
"
4505,"I came to Chicago to see the sights with 3 teenagers. It was a great trip. The condo was comfortable and convenient - right across from the pink line train. When we arrived, Craig chatted with us a bit to let us know about the condo and the area. He provided us with fresh fruit, bagels and pastries, and was available if we needed anything. I read some reviews that said the trains could be loud but we didn't have any problems - even though we are from a small, very quiet town and not used to night noises. We would definitely stay again."
4505,"you must be bored of reading the good things about craig and kathleen's place. if you're not, then you will be soon. 

the rooms are awesome. they had fresh fruits for us (we finished EVERYTHING). they had super yummy bagels (ditto). they had clean comfortable rooms with loads of light, air condition (that they just fixed up). they had clean towels for all of us. 

and now they're going to make the great even better - craig said that they're going to get better internet connection soon. (okay. the internet was a bit wonky at times, but you're in CHICAGO. please go out and have some deep dish pizza, and not stay in to use the internet) 

i'm not writing all these to convince you to stay there. i'm writing this because i want airbnb to better their rankings as well. maybe airbnb should offer sponsored stays for all us review writers so that we will finally be convinced that there're houses out there that deserve even higher ranking than craig and kathleen's place. :)"
4505,"Craig and KathleenÂ´s place is a great opportunity for a group to stay in a complete floor. Very friendly, helpful, we had all the ingredients for a wonderful stay in Chicago. I highly recommend this place for everybody who is open-minded, relaxed and also cool as they are. Thank you Craig again!"
4505,"Craig & Kathleen's place was spacious and comfortable. It was very easy to organize, clean and close to transport- overall a perfect place to stay in Chicago!!!!"
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were amazing to stay with. Before arriving, they were laid back about the special event we were attending while staying with them (a local music festival) and were so nice when it came to any questions we had . Kathleen was away on business during our stay (4 days), but Craig took care of everything that we needed.  After a long bus ride, Craig met us at the door with a local beer (which was awesome) and sat down and answered any questions that we could think of. He showed us everything on a map that we would need, and even offered to take us to buy the train passes that we would need the following morning. The fridge was stocked with bagels, tons of fresh fruit and orange juice. The apartment was super clean, very comfortable (they just installed a new air conditioner), and beautifully decorated with all of Craig's amazing photographs. The next morning, Craig took us to get our train passes like he promised and then let us just enjoy the weekend and have a good time. Mr. Sanchez their dog, and Aaron their cat were so funny to watch run around the yard, which was big and perfect to sit down and hang out in. The trains are literally across the street, but the noise was not bad at all (not as bad as some of the other reviews made it out to be) and hardly noticeable while inside. We slept wonderfully. The only minor problem was the time it took to get downtown by train (20-30 minutes) and that was due to minor construction on the track. What makes Craig and Kathleen's place unique is really all the effort they go through to make sure you are having a great stay. Craig even called us while we were out to tell us a huge thunderstorm was coming, and because of that we were able to find someplace to be inside before the downpour started. Super nice, laid back and friendly people. I hope to stay with Craig and Kathleen every time we are in the area!"
4505,"What a great place to stay.  Craig and Kathleen are easygoing hosts and what a perfect flat to stay in.  The location is further west than many of our Chicago destinations, and yet the close proximity to the pink line and many buses made getting around an absolute breeze.  Thanks so much for such a great place to stay and come home to during our trip"
4505,"Great experience and Craig was a wonderful host. He helped us with any need we had. My wife ran the Chicago marathon and when we went back to pack for our return home, Craig and Kathleen became the cheering section as we walked up. Food and drink in the refrigerator was great to tide us over and the duplex was extremely adequate for my wife and I and the kids. If we have the opportunity, we would stay there again. Thanks Craig and Kathleen."
4505,"We had a great stay at Craig and Kathleen's last weekend! Craig was headed towards the airport just as we were arriving, but took the time to give us some helpful information on getting around the city (and a short cut to the airport).  While we spent most of our time away from the apt, seeing the sights of the city, it was definitely a great place to come back to and get ready for our next day of adventures.  (The fresh fruit, OJ, and coffee cake were also a nice treat!) If we get the chance to visit the city again, we most certainly would try to stay here again!"
4505,"We had a great time at Craig and Kathleen's! If you're looking for a standard overpriced hotel right downtown then this place is not for you.  But if you like unique places that are close to transportation and save you money then you've hit the jackpot here! Craig was super helpful in giving us train directions prior to our arrival and he even stopped to pick us up some beverages since the liquor store would be closed when we arrived. Getting around Chicago cannot be easier with the pink line train right outside your door. Craig suggested we get the 3 day train pass which was a great tip since it was an unlimited pass. We saw much more of the city than our friends who stayed downtown did since the train was so accessible. We really enjoyed feeling like we had a ""home"" in Chicago during our stay. We already miss Mr. Sanchez!"
4505,"Staying at Craig's was good. Really spacious and lots of room for guests. Craig is super helpful with any questions. The addition of fruit, juice and bagels, was awesome. The house is literally right infront of the station, making commutes into the city centre super easy. Not right in the heart of downtown, but close enough. And good enough especially with the price. "
4505,"Staying at this place really helped make our vacation amazing and truely memorable.  It has the comfort of a ""home away from home"", spacious enough for many and cozy enough for two, and is perfectly located.  We loved being right next to the train station, within a perfect walking distance to a grocery store.  
Craig was a wonderful host; flexible with my unusual check-in/check-out times, really informative about the city and how to get around.  He was friendly, welcoming and gracious in letting his place feel like our place.  
We're looking forward to staying again on future visits to Chicago!"
4505,"We had a great time at what we came to call the junction--a lovely apartment right across the street from the Pink Line and almost adjacent to a major train line.  We were not bothered by the train sounds and slept soundly in a pillow topped kingsized airbed that was as comfortable as our Sealy at home.  Our daughter and her boyfriend had the choice of two rooms, one finished, one not, and they too had no complaints.  Sanchez the dog was a great welcome as was Craig who was accessible and warm and left us coffee cake, juice, bagels and cream cheese, and coffee as well.  A very convenient kitchen, and nice hot water.  We know  all neighborhoods of Chicago well and were glad to see that this lively Latino neighborhood is getting spruced up.  A unique experience, not for all visitors to Chicago, but for those of us who are truly interested in all aspects of the city and who enjoy both comfort and adventure, 2000 California is a gem. Oh, yes, the books on the shelf in the big bedroom were just our taste and the linens and towels were bountiful and soft.

susan and willie, emma, and dakota"
4505,"Sam and I had such a great time in this warm and friendly apartment. We had the chance to spend a great evening with Craig and Kathleen and we learnt more about some hidden spots in Chicago. The apartment is huge and the heater system is so comfy! We really appreciated the greeting with bagels, fruis, coffee and juice...well...we just hope to come back shortly.
Oh and by the way, you'll have the chance to see some wonderful pictures from Craig and these unbelievable curving pumpkins! A lot of talent in this lovely house!"
4505,"I was in town for business and the apartment suit my needs just fine. You can't get closer to the train to take you into downtown and it had everything needed, including parking! Would be great for more people as there are 2 other bedrooms beyond the main room. Great price and proximity to the city."
4505,"We came in for Christmas and had a fabulous time! Craig and Kathleen are very warm and welcoming--they even had us up for their Christmas day party, which was really terrific.

We loved the place--the beds were super comfortable, the apartment was equipped with everything we needed, including bagels, cream cheese, milk, and a basketful of fruit for breakfast. We also loved the neighborhood. It's NOT antiseptic, and the rumble of the el and the trains added greatly to the classic Chicago scene. 

We've met a lot of hosts through airbnb, and Craig and Kathleen rank right up there as some of the nicest and most thoughtful. I would highly recommend their place to anybody looking for an authentic, fun, Chicago experience."
4505,"AMAZING!!  I'm a seasoned Airbnb-er, but my in-laws were not and I was a bit worried how they were going to take it.  But as soon as we stepped into the apartment, they loved it and kept saying, ""wow, this is so much better than staying at a hotel!""  The apartment is spacious and clean.  We really appreciated the fruit and bagels (one less meal you have to worry about.)  Oh, and the location is fantastic!  Across the street is the train and from there you can go anywhere you please in Chicago.  Thank you Craig and Kathleen for hosting us - we had a blast!"
4505,"I would highly recommend staying with Craig and Kathleen!
First of all the, the place is so cute and toasty, which was great for a cold Chicago weekend in December and it was SUPER convenient having the train, literally right outside.
 
Secondly, they have everything set up just as you would if you were staying at a hotel, if you forgot towels, they have them!  If you get cold at night, no worries there are extra blankets! And if you wake up the first morning a little hungry, there's fresh fruit, tea and coffee cake waiting!
What I really appreciated the most though was the first night when we showed up late, Kathleen waited for us patiently and Craig came downstairs to introduce himself, share a drink and get to know us all a little bit!

It was a great stay with very nice people!"
4505,"I can only echo all of the other positive reviews. The location was superb, right next to the ""L"" without being too noisy (sleep was never interrupted). The place was also inviting and warm... we were there during a single digit cold snap and felt no drafts or need to bundle up inside which was impressive by itself. Fruits/bagels/coffee were a very nice touch, and linens and little conveniences were all so thoughtfully provided. We wanted for nothing, except maybe a longer stay! Thanks, Craig, for opening your home to us. We hope to be back again sooner than later!"
4505,"We had such a pleasant stay at Craig and Kathleen's home.  The space is extremely private, cozy, and creatively decorated with Craig's photographs and funky vintage furniture.  Mornings were particularly delightful, with coffee, bagels, and fruit provided. We enjoyed cooking breakfast in the fully stocked kitchen while listening to Ray Charles on the vintage record player.  We had a garage for our car, easy access to anywhere in the city, and immediate assistance from Craig whenever anything was needed.  Thanks to our gracious hosts Craig and Kathleen. If the opportunity arises we will definitely be back!  "
4505,"We had a great time.  The apartment is very comfortable and clean and the location is perfect.   Craig and Kathleen were always available for us.   Their collection of photos is great!
Highly recommended.
"
4505,"Craig and Kathleen are the nicest hosts I've had on Airbnb. They went beyond the call of duty, picked us up from our bus stop, had food waiting for us, and even when we couldn't figure out how to order a pizza (it's a long story) Craig helped us :). I hope to get a chance to stay with Craig and Kathleen again and hear more of their impressive stories (I'm still amazed that they were there during the Japan Earthquake!!!). I truly recommend the place. It's conveniently located and a really spacious apartment. THANK YOU!! "
4505,"What can we say that hasn't been said already on here? Craig and Kathleen are top hosts, no question about it. They are nicer than nice. Their place was perfect for us, well conected to downtown Chicago and the airport. Yes, ok, so it is a bit close to the rail tracks and sometimes you might hear the sound of the trains, but let's be honest, if you, like us, are in Chicago as a tourist and you see the city from dawn til dusk, by the time you get back you'll be to tired to hear any trains or anything else for that matter. And if you're used to sleep in a quiet area, just get some earplugs.

If you're looking for accomodation in Chicago with a bit of an authentic feel, don't think about it and contact Craig and Kathleen.

"
4505,"We loved absolutely everything about this apartment. If you don't too, well, then...somethin' just ain't right with you!

Where to begin...well, the hosts were very friendly, super accommodating, easy to talk to, and honestly, they were so normal - you know, the good, level-headed normal that is a rarity these days. What a treat! Plus, the two four-legged family members were an added bonus - I have so many pictures of Chicago, half of them are of the cat, this is a fact.

The apartment itself is huge (just the two of us, but we plan on returning with a few friends in tow). It was spotless, inviting, really neat rooms (the rustic one is super cool). Really, it was just so comfortable...when I asked my boyfriend to help describe what he thought of it, he said ""At first it felt like we were at home, except with a TV.""  Now it can't get more comfortable than that! Just don't watch too much of it - for those who don't know, Chicago is massive, with tons to explore. Speaking of exploring, the neighborhood here is pretty sweet. First, the train station is literally across the street, so you can get anywhere you want from the front door. We do regret not trying one of the authentic Mexican restaurants in the area, but we plan to the next time. Which there will be. 

Don't miss out on this one!! :D


"
4505,"We had a great time staying at Craig and Kathleen's apartment. It was perfect for my two college friends and me. The apartment was very comfortable, clean and the location is perfect. Craig was very helpful with accommodating us arriving later than anticipated. Bagels and fruit were appreciated. Highly recommended!!!"
4505,"For our 10th wedding anniversary we were going to splurge on a fancy hotel, but happened to run across Craig and Kathleen's place. We are very glad we did.  It was so much cheaper than a hotel, and an overall better experience. We used two of their bikes to ride around town. The train station is right there. It was clean, convenient, and personal. I always felt like Craig and Kathleen were available if we needed travel tips, but we felt all to ourselves in the first floor apartment with high ceilings and an artistic charm."
4505,"It was just as all the other reviews stated.  Clean and comfortable.  Right across from the train which is faster than driving and parking downtown.  If you are like I am and don't like the tin can feel of a hotel and don't mind getting out of the hotel enviroment, you will like this place.  It is by the trains so you will hear them but big deal, after running around Chicago all day it din't even register.   We put our car in the garage and only got it out once for butter and then once for beer and tequlia (the best selection I've ever seen in the US and cheap as Cozumel).  Hosts were great  & would stay again."
4505,Enjoyed a mini family reunion here...5 adults. I would recommend this rental space. The host was always ready to help when we had a question. Train noise was not a problem for any of us at night we all slept well. If you are planning a trip to Chicago and want to be close to train line and some good Mexican restaurants this is it.
4505,"My friend and I were staying in Chicago for the first time. The location is nice because it is very close to the train station. We took a cab a couple of times after being out at night. We never paid more than $15. There aren't any great places to eat around the apartment, but a short train ride takes you downtown. We didn't get to meet Craig or Kathleen because they were out of town; however, they had a friend who was very helpful getting us settled and they called to check on how we were doing. The apartment was true to the pictures. It has a private entrance from their apartment. We would stay here again. "
4505,"We stayed at Craig and Kathleen's place May 3-6.  There were 8 of us and we just can't say enough how hospitable they were.  The place was easily large enough for us to be comfortable. Also  clean and lovely .  Loved the photographs on the walls.
|Access to the train was a huge bonus and our 3 children loved the noise of the trains.  They also loved Mr. Sanchez and the cat.
This place comes highly recommended and we will consider it the next time we go to Chicago."
4505,"Ahhhh, what an adventure we had in Chicago!  Thanks to Craig and Kathleen, our journey was without hassel in regards to travel, we were very appreciative of Craig's offer to meet us at the bus stop and get us where we needed to be.  He made sure my sister and my 83 year old mother got on a taxi and then took my other sister and i on the train so we would know how to execute that transportation.  When my mom and sister got to Craig and Kathleen's house, they were greeted with a smile and a bottle of (Website hidden by Airbnb) mom still talks about that.  We also appreciated Craig having 3 day train passes for each of us....they really did make our journey easy.  And that's just transportation.....the fruit, coffe, juice, and bagels with creme cheese started our mornings out with healthy choices ( much apprecaited as that was about our only healthy choice each day!)  We loved the airy space to lounge and play cards. My mom had fun listening to Frank Sinatra on an actual record player.  Having the train station right across the street was a BIG plus.  I don't think there is a think we could say that wouldn 't be a positive.  We enjoyed our stay and will be back for our next viist."
4505,"It was our first airbnb experience and Craig and Kathleen were very gentle! The apartment was as pictured and felt like home.  Situated in a culturally interesting area.  Not in the middle of the action, but we liked being in a real neighbourhood that didn't cater for tourists. We wanted for nothing.  And the real fruit, not a display, was most welcome.  When we ran out of fruit it was time to leave!  That was a generous addition and our request for soy milk was kindly provided.  Craig was happy for a chat and gave us some helpful tips. And the apartment was very clean.  The train at the doorstep was certainly convenient, but earplugs are essential if you're a light sleeper.  All in all a lovely introduction to airbnb and a great beginning to our journey around the world."
4505,"Great place for a few days in Chicago ! The appartment is very closed to the CTA and it takes 20 mn to go to the loop. It's a big and comfortable place to stay with amazing pictures on the walls ! Craig is very friendly. He's bought many things for breakfast. I recommand the place and I will come back here next time I come in Chicago.    
"
4505,"Big house, big everything.Kathleen and Craig are
terrific hosts. They welcome you with fruit, beer and vegemite
What more could an Aussie want
Big house is adjacent to the Pink rail line
so is ideal for getting to downtown Chicago"
4505,Great hosts and super close to Downtown Chicago!
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were very proactive, attentive, and responsive hosts. Craig greeted us upon our arrival, showed us around the place, had a fresh bowl of fruit on the kitchen table, and had purchased three-day CTA passes ahead of time as a convenient way for us to buy passes and to save the time and hassle of buying them later through CTA. Craig and Kathleen really cared that our stay was going well and responded right away to our two voicemail requests.  We did find the surrounding neighborhood to be rougher than we envisioned, but the neighborhood people we spoke to during our three-day whirlwind trip for our sonâ€™s graduation were nice folks. It would have been a neat experience to have interfaced more with the authentic Chicago neighborhood had we more time."
4505,"The lodging (actually a full floor of a house) was extremely spacious (enough for 6-8 people) with a fully functioning kitchen and included a basket of fruit, tea, coffee and bagels & cream cheese. Beds were comfortable and falling asleep to the dulcet tones issuing from cable tv was a familiar way to drift off to sleep. When a small plumbing issue arose, we were issued a refund for the full amount of the stay. Integrity. I would highly recommend dealing with Craig and Kathleen."
4505,"Had a fabulous weekend in this adorable apartment! Itâ€™s very Chicagoâ€¦older, high ceilings, wood floors. The fruit and bagels was a wonderful touch. Also provided milk and OJ, but never used it (felt bad about that). Found the basket of Chicago maps/magazines/brochures very helpful. Everything was very clean. More than enough linens, towels, dishes provided. The Chicago photos decorating the walls in the apartment are very nice. Listened to some of the old records lying around. The neighborhood is a little rough, but I wasnâ€™t out late much so it didnâ€™t really factor into my weekend. Some people might have an issue with the trains running so close, but I actually loved this part! I found having the pink line across the street was a bonus. Craig was a wonderful host. He made contact on Friday to make sure I was on schedule, took time to explain the neighborhood and where things were. Even took me to the Pride Parade on Sunday, since my date was a no-show for the weekend and Katherine was working. As I was leaving I did find there was room in the closet for hanging clothes and an iron, but I never needed it. Will definitely stay again!"
4505,"Our stay at Craig's and Kathleen's place was wonderful, just as the other reviews reflect. The place was clean and looked exactly as pictured. Most of all, the accessibility to the Loop made our stay in Chicago so convenient. Craig let us park our car in the garage on the first day of our visit, and we never had to move the car until we had to go. The house is literally across the street from the Pink line. I would definitely recommend their place!"
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were perfect hosts. Their place is absolutely fabulous and we liked the whole experience. The photographs in the flat are magnificent. The place is big, we were five people and had easily enough room. 
Craig and Kathleen were very helpful in all regards. Craig biked with me one mile to the next Walgreens to get the CTA passes and Kathleen organized a mechanic to jump start our car after the battery ran down. The house is not in center town, but right next to the CTA pink line station, which offers an easy 20min ride right into the loop. If you like Mexican food, you are at the right place, too. "
4505,"I am obsessed with Craig. Love these two and this house was great. My volleyball team hit up Chicago for a tournament and this was our crash pad. They treated us like friends and welcomed us in. They made exceptions for our large party and hooked us up with coffee and fruit and bagels for breakfast the day of our first match! The place is great and the neighborhood----while not located specifically great for our needs, is spot on for mass transit or easy access. We also were happy to find a white castle less than a mile away for late night drunk food needs! THIS PLACE IS A FREAKIN' STEAL if you are traveling in a group! Simple, easy, and very friendly."
4505,"We stayed in Craig & Kathleen's place for 4 nights. Craig helped me navigate our way to their place before we got there. Great service from the beginning. When we got in Craig was at work, but his friend Shaun took care of us.The apartment is decorated so nicely and the photographs on the wall (taken by Craig) are beautiful. Craig and Kathleen never got in our way, and were always there if we had questions. On our last night there, we misplaced a set of keys. Craig and Kathleen were nice enough to not make a big deal out of it. We also rented a car for a day and were able to park it in the driveway. If you're going to Chicago, I recommend staying here. Craig is so incredibly nice, and Mr.Sanchez (dog) is the sweetest. Oh, and like everyone else, we had fruit and other breakfast essentials waiting for us when we arrived, also."
4505,This is a great place to stay if you are here to tour the city.  The location makes it easy to get in and out of Chicago.  We were comfortable and  felt welcomed. 
4505,"Highly recommended! Craig & Kathleen were lovely hosts: friendly, helpful, and very fair. The place is roomy, comfortable, and charming. Convenient location made getting around on public transportation a breeze. Couldn't ask for anything more! Thanks for making our first airbnb experience a positive one! "
4505,"It was our first airbnb-experience and it was much better than we ever expected - it was absolutely fantastic! Craig and Kathleen are the best hosts you can get. They are friendly, helpful and crazy in a very positive way. We spent some really great evenings with them.
The apartment offers a lot of space, it was clean and very cool furnished.
If you ever want to stay in Chicago, stay there!!!!!!!"
4505,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Craig is such a cool guy and we loved Aaron and Mr. Sanchez. The place looks just the same as it does in the pictures (minus the rooms that have been redone). I would definitely recommend this place to anyone planning to stay in Chicago, as long as they don't mind a short ride on the L train. We had a great time!"
4505,"Craig and Kathleen are super chill hosts. Their apt is quaint and clean. Fresh towels all around! Their pets are adorable and friendly. They were very helpful as a whole. Maps and directions were always available. The fresh fruit, milk, and bagels were heartwarming. Great location too! "
4505,"The location was very convenient; right across the street from the El. The apt itself was great. Bed was comfy and we had a full kitchen plus iron/ironing board, which proved to be handy. Lovely architectural details. Craig and Kathleen were great hosts. My only rec is that if you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs.
"
4505,Craig is hilarious and a great host. The apartment is huge and can easily sleep a slew of people. You could easily stay here for days and never need a car or any transportation than the L. Pete's Fresh Market is a 10 minute walk and has TONS of fresh produce and baked goods. With the huge kitchen you can definitely provide food for yourself the entire time. This is the real Chicago experience!
4505,"Craig and Kathleen's place was just what we'd hoped for. Very roomy (definitely more space than the two of us needed!) perfectly clean, air-conditioned, and just across the street from the train. I'd recommend it very highly and I'd stay there again for sure. Unfortunately, they were out of town so we didn't meet them, but they had a friend house sitting who was very helpful with anything we needed. 

If you need a place to stay in Chicago, stay here!"
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were great hosts and Chicago is a great city.  The location is very close to the Pink line train, so easy access to the transit to downtown.  They had all the essentials needed for your stay, juice, fruit, etc to start you on your day, and having your own space was great to relax after your day.  Since the location is close to the train, is a little noisey.  We always pack ear plugs, so this did help. Other then that, I would recommend their place to everyone.  Awesome value and people.
Forgot to mention that there is great Mexican food and Pastry/Bakery around the corner to your left if you are facing the house.  Lots of options to dine in or get take out if not wanting to eat downtown for a night."
4505,"Love this apartment! Craig and Kathleen did an excellent job on the renovations. We wish we had more than just a weekend to really enjoy living here. Having the pink line right across the street was perfect. Just walk outside and hop on the train. Craig was an excellent host. He was waiting for us outside when our cab pulled up, showed us around, gave us some tips, and made himself available in case we needed him. Mr. Sanchez the dog is the cutest, nicest dog you'll ever meet. Everyone is a friend to her! We had a great time checking out the touristy stuff in Chicago and we'll definitely be back for the stuff we missed. I can't imagine staying anywhere else. It's convenient to the loop but not crazy expensive like everything else. And since it's so large, we could easily bring some friends. And we'll probably cook a few meals ourselves in the huge kitchen next time. Can't wait to come back and stay longer!"
4505,"Coming from LA, Scottsdale, and The Netherlands our family of 4 re-united in our beloved hometown Chicago using Craig & Kathleen's southside home as our base.  Their accomodations are spacious,comfortable,and styled with nostalgic vintage furniture and amazing photos, giving this urban crib a very creative Chicagoan vibe.  Located deep in the ethnic zone - tourists get an immersion of the city's Latino, Italian, Mexican flavors and the various train rails (CTA, Metra, & freight) in the vicinity, provide an industrial rhythm unique to Chi-town (light sleepers will need earplugs).  Craig & Kathleen are seasoned international travellers and experienced hosts that understand guests needs and serve Chicago to you on a silver plate.  Thank you for a unique urban experience!"
4505,"Had a wonderful time, great location for train. Craig was very helpful and obliging, pointed us to the local grocery and made sure we had lots of info on how to get around. There was fresh fruit, bagels, cream cheese,milk and juice and he even provided Vegemite.

Craig was always available and responded to all our queries both before and during our stay.

Would happily stay there again if we make it back to Chicago.

Highly recommended."
4505,"Perfect Airbnb experience. Friendly hosts, clean apartment, plenty of space. HIghly recommended"
4505,"The host was not home when we arrived on the weekend, but their friend Sean was nice enough to greet us right at the door and gave us the key. Kathleen gave us a warm and friendly greeting when she did returned home . The house is old, but basic amenities are all there, and it was a huge space for two of us. The heat system was good, kept us warm and toasty at night when it was quite chilly during the 4 days we were there. It is located literally right next to the California station on the pink line, it is very convenient to hop onto the cta train, but the commute to dt does take around 30 mins, it feels a bit long at times, especially when the trains are slow. Overall it was a positive experience, very nice and friendly host!"
4505,"We ( young family of 3 ) had a fantastic stay at Craig & Kathleen's place! Craig was out of town, so we didn't get to meet him but he always responded to any questions right away. Kathleen was an amazing host, she is very sweet and made us feel very comfortable, she even helped us carrying our bags on the way back to get us to the right train station to the airport. Sanchez, the dog is also super nice.
The apartment is big, clean, very cozy and you're provided with everything you need, even bagels, cream cheese, fruit, coffee and orange juice for breakfast which was great to get us and our two year old started in the morning! We also loved how they decorated the place, all of Craig's photos on the walls are amazing.
Yes, it is a bit noisy, you can hear the trains at night but if you don't mind using earplugs, it's fine.
Highly recommend this place, would definitely stay there again! 
Thanks Kathleen, thanks Craig!"
4505,"We were in town for a Chicago wedding and Craig and Kathleen's flat was a good choice for our party of 6.  We drove in from Milwaukee and put the rental car in their garage...and only got it out to attend the wedding and to head to the airport.  You do not need a car as the pink line public transport is a short walk away. Bring cash as they didn't take credit cards.   In fact we got caught in lots a traffic driving to the airport on Sunday afternoon...which according to the rental car return person is an every Sunday afternoon event!  As we sat in traffic we watched the trains go by! 
If you love trains you will like this flat as the pink line is on one side and Amtrak is on the other.  We found once we knew the sound of both trains it didn't bother us at all.  
The flat is urban chic with Craig's photos and  comfy eclectic furniture.  The beds are all air beds which were very comfortable.  Linens and towels were plentiful.  The kitchen as basic micro and fridge and coffee maker.  The breakfast was fruit and bagels.  
Craig and Kathleen answered email and text promptly and made us feel welcome.  
"
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were away but Sean was great at welcoming us to the house. Loved the bagels and fruit left for us. Place was very clean and tidy. The train was so close and very handy for travelling into the city. Had a really enjoyable stay, thanks guys!"
4505,"Great little apartment -- very convenient to train, and also offers off-street parking. 

But the really great thing is that the hosts are totally amazing.  Great communication, fantastic directions and fun to chat with. 

We had a great stay here."
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were excellent hosts and on hand to help out and advice on anything. Flat is just perfect. Rustic-yes. Spacious-yes. comfortable-yes. Clean-yes.  What you can't tell from the advert and pics...the flat has charm. It oozes charm. It is next door to the CTA train service into the downtown (operating 5.20- 01.30), which is perfect. It is a short stroll to the heart of the Mexican area Little Village), 5 mins walk to the supermarket, 1 stop away from a great diner (at Western). In short the location is first class. The beds are comfy. The flat is cosy warm. All is great!!  The flat is neighboured on both sides by train lines so bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper. "
4505,"We stayed at Craig and Kathleen's for two nights in Chicago and couldn't have found a better place to stay, we had great hosts, Craig even walked with us to find a liquor store and helped us with the train which was across the road......perfect spot and so easy to get into downtown Chicago"
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were great hosts. The rooms were exactly as described and very comfortable for the three of us. OJ and fresh bagels in the fridge were very much appreciated.

Proximity to the train made getting around a breeze, and we had no issues with noise."
4505,"In February 2012, I stayed at the Chicago Getaway Hostel with my children. At the communal breakfast table, we met a group of students from Thailand. I told them I was originally from Chicago and they looked confused, in Thailand they explained, I would have a family compound with aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins in my home city. Mine is a family divided however, in suburbs, a farm, and studio apartments. Craig and Kathleen gave me the opportunity to realize my family compound dreams during our December holiday tour. Instead of making the trek to the farm, we invited our cast of beloveds to the city. Four generations slept comfortably and we added aunts, uncles, and cousins for daytime visits. Apart from the spacious, accommodating  digs, the neighborhood is a sweet place to explore. An amazing grocery and satisfying restaurants within walking distance, as well as Douglas Park and the Pink Line. This is a truly remarkable spot in an incredible city. Thank you, Craig and Kathleen, for providing a displaced Chicagoan with a wonderful home. "
4505,"Nice place, everything worked fine, no surprises! Went to Chicago to share a moment with friends. The spot was a bit far from downtown but the pink line is literally across the streets and brings you there fairly fast."
4505,"7 of us visited Chicago for two nights of concerts. Craig's place was perfect for us. He has a great sense of humor and is really laid back. He and the dog, Mr. Sanchez greeted us as we arrived. There was parking for both our cars. His place is clean and has a nice comfortable feel to it. We all immediately felt at home there. We sat with Craig for a little while having some beers and getting to know each other a bit. We all enjoyed walking around getting lost in the photos he had up all over the place. He's an excellent photographer and had taken all of the photos himself. There were several photos that we just couldn't stop looking at because they were so interesting. Craig shared the stories behind them, which made them all the more intriguing. 

Craig was attentive to making our stay as comfortable as possible. When we ran out of toilet paper, he was down within 5 minutes with more. There was a whole bunch of fresh fruit, bagels, cream cheese, etc stocked up for us. 

The rooms are a bit small, but a good enough size for sleeping and changing clothes. Craig has done a nice job of elevating the beds to make room for luggage storage. Having a nice living room to hang out in more than makes up for the small-ish rooms. The kitchen is also sizable, and has a table, so between that and the living room and the bedrooms, the 7 of us never felt cramped together. Craig warned us that he thought the one bathroom might be a challenge with 7 of us, but we all got along just fine with it. Some of us showered in the evening when we got home from the shows, and some of us showered in the morning. No problem. 

The place is right next to the train station, which was incredibly handy. When it's quiet in the apartment, you can hear the trains, but it's not disruptive. Several of us remarked that we actually found the low rumble somewhat soothing. Craig was really helpful about giving us instructions on how to use the transit system and helped us get a decent lay of the area. He's honest and straightforward, but also quite friendly.

In summary, we felt like we were staying with a hospitable old friend, a far more relaxing alternative to some soul-deprived, thin-walled, dressed-up dormitory of a hotel. No standing in line to check in. No miserable desk worker trying to pretend to be happy you're there. No neighboring doors constantly slamming. No life-hating housekeeper ignoring the do-not-disturb sign at 9am. 

Instead, we got a genuinely cool new friend, a cute dog to pet, a chill place to hang out, and a really sweet photo souvenir that's hanging in my office now, constantly reminding me of the wonderful weekend we had in Chicago. 

Thanks, Craig! "
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were excellent hosts and their apartment was perfect! I was in town for work and their apartment was both on the CTA line and walking distance to my training area. They were so kind to help me with any questions I had about the area and even had bagels, strawberries and orange juice waiting for me in the fridge. I would definitely stay there again. "
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were terrific hosts and relaxed open people we were happy to meet. 
The place is amazing and has soul. Very clean and equipped with what guests need to feel at home away from home. 
They even prepared us creamcheese, bagels and fruits for our stay and were very helpfluf with advice 
Hope to stay there soon again. 
"
4505,"We had a very great time at Craig and Kathleen's apartment. We were a party of 4 people and stayed for 3 nights. The apartment is located one house away from the train station, which makes taking the train into Chicago easy and convenient. We didn't meet Kathleen but Craig was a great host. He greeted us when we arrived, showed us around the apartment, and kept in touch with us throughout our stay to make sure everything is ok. Craig even helped my dad fix his glasses. The apartment is very spacious and has 4 comfortable beds. It looks like the pictures shown above. Although it's an older apartment, great care has been done to keep up the place. Craig provided towels, linen, even hair dryer. No bed bugs or mice (which I am always concerned about when staying at hotels/b&bs). We all felt safe throughout our stay. There's a Pete's fresh market about 10 min walk away, which made cooking a lot easier and convenient. Craig& Kathleen live in the apartment above with a dog and cat. We didn't see cat too much, but the dog was very friendly. Overall it was a very positive experience. I would totally recommend this apartment to others who want to travel to Chicago. Thank you Craig and Kathleen!"
4505,"Craig & Kathleen's place was great!  Comfortable, clean and a perfect location near the train. Highly recommended for your next trip to Chicago."
4505,Everything is great! It's a convenient location with pink line. The dog and cat are sweet cuties.
4505,"We had a great time at Craig and Kathleen's place. They were very gracious hosts, and their place is really nice. It is very conveniently located to the Pink Line of the transit system. You do hear the trains, but it's oddly soothing. We liked the local Mexican restaurant down the street, and the grocery store was great as well.  We'd like to come back with the kids sometime -- there is lots of room for a family to stay. "
4505,"Craig and Kathleen are personable, thoughtful hosts. Online photos only hint at how spacious the apartment really is. You'll enjoy privacy and comfort just a few steps from public transportation. (This was our first Air BnB experience, and it was such a high quality experience at such a low price, I suspect it's in a class by itself.) I feel we ""lucked out"" on this one."
4505,"Craig was great. Right across from the Pink Line. Super convenient! 

I would stay here again. "
4505,"Everything as described was there!  We had a party of 5 and it was plenty spacious with the 4 beds.  Craig left us some fruit, bagels, cream cheese, milk, and orange juice.  There was also cable tv for those late nights and the NBA playoffs!

Very conveniently located right next to the pink line (california stop).  It takes about 30 minutes to get to the city.  You do hear the trains but we were so tired from being tourist that it wasn't a problem for us.

Overall, my friends and I had a great time at Craig's place.  Great price, great location, great hosts.  Aaron and Sanchez were the friendliest animals as well.  Thanks a bunch Craig and Kathleen."
4505,"Our arrival into Chicago was delayed due to a storm but Craig was there to guide us in and meet us at the doorstep at 3 am! Thank you Craig... The place was very comfortable, convenient and had a great feel about it. Having the Pink line so close allowed us to easily access Chicago. If you are worried about train noise - you will hear them but we found them to be very soothing. We slept very well but if you are sensitive to noise bring ear plugs. Unfortunately we did not get meet Kathleen but Craig was attentive. We would stay there again.  "
4505,"What else can be said that hasn't already  been said about Craig's and Kathleen's  place.  It was our first AirBNB rental and it was awesome.  Craig was an excellent host and my two sons loved throwing the ball with Mr Sanchez in the yard.  Having the pink line next to the house allowed for easy access to downtown.  I would highly recommend the apt.  Craig had a basket of fruit, bagels, and cream cheese waiting on our arrival, and he called us during our sightseeing to warn us about an approaching storm.  There is a large park near the house, and there is a Pete's Fresh Market two blocks away.  I was able to use one of Craig's bicycles to ride to the market. As we left, Craig asked us to pick out one of his 4x6 photographs of Chicago as a souvenir.  He is a very talented photographer, and we enjoyed viewing his collection throughout the apartment.  Overall, it was a great experience.  We can't wait to go back to Chicago, and Yes, we will be staying at Craig's and Kathleen's place!!!"
4505,"We were very comfortable in our brief stay.  The place had plenty of room with comfy beds, nice bathroom and a stocked kitchen. Craig and Kathleen are super hosts.  We'd stay again."
4505,"Craig was a great host! This was my first AirBnB experience and I will definitely be back! It's nice to have a clean kitchen to cook in, cable television, wifi, and of course an abundance of beds to choose from. There were bagels available and we picked up groceries from the story up the street! 

Craig always checked in and made sure all was well. The house was super conveniently located right across from the L (Chicago's subway) so my friend and I never had to cab! "
4505,"We didn't have the chance to see them much during our brief stay because we were out of the house most of the time but Craig and Kathleen were brilliant hosts and solid communicators throughout the process.  Even when we were a couple of hours late, they were very understanding!  My friends and I (4 of us) immediately felt very comfortable in the spacious apartment.  One of my friends found the trains to be a bit too noisy for them but the rest of us slept right through it so you may want ear plugs if you aren't a deep sleeper.  The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was clean, kitchen was stocked up, and lots of great art to sit back and look at.  Add on WiFi, some awesome Mexican restaurants, and the fact that the train is super close by, I'd highly recommend staying here and would stay here again."
4505,"Fun, clean apartment with lots of beds to choose from. The kitchen was well stocked, both with equipment and with breakfast foods. We had a very comfortable stay and appreciated Craig's hospitality. The apartment is right next to the subway station, which is great. It's a bit of a hike to get downtown, but the neighbourhood is lovely and the place is next to a gorgeous park."
4505,"Craig and Kathleen's place was a great experience.  It's a little uptown but very convenient to downtown via CTA trains.  The views from the train going into town are unique.  They have kept the ""Chicago town"" feel in this large apartment which made it very rejuvenating when returning from site seeing all day, and yet, planning our next day's adventures.  Craig was very helpful with giving us pointers on seeing sites that the common tourist might miss.  
The apartment did get a little loud with the trains at night, but I am a bit of a train buff, which made it that much more interesting with that  ""Chicago Town"" feel.  As well, we come from a very quiet place these days and we are not quite use to the city sounds anymore.
Our children enjoyed having their own space which is now becoming an issue in hotels.  We appreciated that the apartment was well stocked with fresh fruit and milk for the morning coffee or tea.  The little things that one forgets when travelling.
We would recommend Craig and Kathleen's place to anyone and we haven't stopped telling people of our great experience ever since we got back.  We plan on returning to Chicago to take in some of the other experiences such as the Jazz spots and restaurants and we would not hesitate staying here again.  "
4505,Wow.What a great place and great host.I enjoyed staying with Craig and Kathleen.They really made you feel at home.From their  home  it is a very quick trip into downtown.The place was very clean and safe.I will defintely return here.Hey Craig have a cold one and think  of me.Thank you very much
4505,"We have had a wonderful stay in a wonderful apartment. Spacious, very nicely decorated, and with lots of beautiful pictures taken by Craig. Craig is a great host, he showed me around in the neighbourhood and went into town just to get us CTA tickets that were not available around the corner. Highly recommended! "
4505,Where else can you get PRIVATE comfortable beds and a great price!  PLUS Craig had the 3 bikes aired up for us with helmets and locks so we could ride through Douglas Park and into Pilsen to tour the museum at NO COST! What a wonderful 3 days.
4505,"Craig and Kathleen's place is beautiful and spacious. It is tastefully decorated, fully furnished and very clean. I felt very comfortable dealing with them. It felt like I was in my own home. Craig and Kathleen were very helpful and welcoming. "
4505,"TrÃ¨s bon accueil et disponibilitÃ©. L'appartement est parfait et correspond tout Ã  fait au descriptif. De plus son emplacement permet de voir un autre aspect de Chicago.
En rÃ©sumÃ© nous avons beaucoup apprÃ©ciÃ© notre sÃ©jour! "
4505,This is a great place to stay. Craig and Kathleen made us feel so welcome!  I highly recommend it!
4505,"Een leuk ingericht en heel ruim appartement (we waren met 4 personen) op 50 meter afstand van het metro station. Overdag is het heerlijk rustig, maar 's nachts ihoor je het lawaai van de metro of de trein. Oordopjes meenemen dus. Craig is bijzonder vriendelijk en behulpzaam.   "
4505,"Great, easy place to stay. They are both really sweet, having breakfast in the house is awesome. We had trouble waiting for a cab that never came to get to the airport during rush hour. They told us the easiest way when they saw us waiting. They are great and we'd totally stay again. "
4505,"Second time around, even better than the first.  This place is great, close to transport, food market not far away, heaps of space and room to move.

It's like a second home, the pets are wonderful and so are the hosts :-)

Would highly recommend and can't wait to go back to Chicago."
4505,"Craig y Kathleen fueron unos anfitriones excelentes. Kathleen nos recibiÃ³ a pesar de que eran cerca de las 11 de la noche. En el refrigerador nos dejaron leche, bagels y jugo de naranja. La cocina es muy amplia y tiene todo para cocinar, lo que nos permitiÃ³ desayunar y cenar en casa.
En el baÃ±o habÃ­a toallas limpias y muchos jabones Grisi para escoger.
El departamento es justo como aparece en las fotos y tiene calefacciÃ³n. Muy amplio y cÃ³modo. Un dÃ­a antes de partir Craig pasÃ³ a saludar y nos preguntÃ³ si necesitÃ¡bamos algo de la tienda! Le dijimos que no, pero me pareciÃ³ un gesto muy amable.
La casa estÃ¡ a media cuadra de una estaciÃ³n del metro y los convoyes hacen algo de ruido, pero para mÃ­ fue preferible estar cerca del metro y poder movernos por toda la ciudad rÃ¡pidamente en transporte pÃºblico.
El barrio es tranquilo y con toda seguridad volverÃ­a a hospedarme aquÃ­.
"
4505,Six of us ( age ranging from 24 to 54) plus a 7-month-old all enjoyed our stay! I especially love the living room with large windows and elegant furniture! The location is good too- just one mins to the CTA! 
4505,"Craig's place was clean and spacious, a great place for our party of seven (including four kids under five). There was also a garage spot for our minivan which was nice given the permitted street parking. 

For drivers, the house is a bit of a trek from downtown and all the main shopping/restaurants/museums. For those taking public trans, the train is literally across the street. With our large brood we stuck to the minivan. 

Craig was very helpful and attentive. He provided juice, milk, fruit, and bagels and checked in on us to see if we needed anything. Craig's place is the best you're going to find with this price point and proximity to all that Chicago has to offer!"
4505,"The house is perfectly located across the street from the pink line.  Grocery and food nearby.  Fresh fruit, clean linens, orange juice and bagels were available when we arrived.  The water pressure is fantastic.  The towels are thick, luxurious and smell fantastic.  Very clean.  I would recommend Craig and Kathleen's rental to anyone.  Large spacious rooms, clean."
4505,"This apartment was just perfect for us! My husband, brother-in-law and I were able to just walk a few steps to get on the Pink Line CTA elevated train to the Loop. The neighborhood was friendly and safe with some great Mexican restaurants a few blocks away. Craig was a great host and provided a few little extras because of our special dietary needs. It was nice to be able to come back to the apartment and relax together after a wonderful day seeing Chicago sights!"
4505,My wife and I came down on a trip with another couple and we had a great time.  Craig was very welcoming and informative about local activities.  We had a minor issue with a broken shower head but he had that fixed within a few hours and it did not effect our plans in the least.  Would definitely stay here again.
4505,"The appartment of Craig and Kathleen is great, very spacious, with everything you could need for your stay. It's just near the subway, it's easy to go downtown. There's a big groceries store nearby. But above all, Craig and Kathleen are great hosts. Craig welcomed us with a big basket of fruits, milk, bagels and a bottle of wine. We could count on them if we have any questions. We spent a really nice moment with them."
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were wonderful hosts in a great city!  The house was warm and inviting, clean and cozy. We enjoyed visiting various city sites and coming back to the house to put our feet up and relax.  It was interesting to check out the photos Craig has taken and hung all over the house.  Thanks for sharing your home with us!"
4505,"I have to say it was an excellent experience in Craig 's house. The house is cozy and comfortable and Craig is really very nice. The house is just near the subway station, which is very convenient for us to travel in Chicago. If you want to find a place to live and enjoy in Chicago, Craig's is the best choice."
4505,"We loved staying in Craig and Kathleen's airbnb! Great hosts and such a lovely cosy house in a great location for access to the train and local shops. From the spacious living areas, the great photos of Chicago scenes by Craig on the walls, the comfy beds and right down to the Elvis soap holder dishes, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would love to go back and spend more time there again one day!"
4505,"We stayed here two nights.  The apartment was an outstanding value.  It was fun to arrive and explore it all, from the various rooms to the awesome photos on the walls.  As noted by others, it's right next to the L.  Upon first arriving, I was concerned the noise from the same was going to be a problem, but not once did I notice it through the night.  It may have even been soothing, if that's possible.  The bed was surprisingly comfortable and everything was clean.

There was fresh bagels, cream cheese, orange juice and milk in the fridge, which was very nice to have in the morning.

Unfortunately Craig and Kathleen were vacationing in Florida during our stay so we didn't get to meet them.  Craig was kind enough to text a picture of the warmth they were experiencing in December there.  How thoughtful! :-)  They had a friend Sean let us in and answer questions and he did a great job in their absence.  

About the only negative I could say would be the location.  The house definitely is not located in an upscale area.  I never felt unsafe or anything, it just isn't somewhere touristy or posh.  I liked that - I prefer to stay somewhere to get a truer feel of a city versus staying at a tourist-trap-hotel, but others might not like it.

The next time we go back to Chicago we'd definitely stay there again.
"
4505,"Craig and Kathleen's apartment was warm and welcoming in wintry Chicago!  We had everything we needed for a great stay!  Our family's favorite things were the ample living space, photography and tea selection!"
4505,This is a great place to stay! The hosts are incredible. They are super nice andâ€¦ free breakfast?! Really saved me from trudging into the snow first thing in the morning. I especially loved being across from the train. Super convenient! You can go anywhere so it really doesn't matter that the neighborhood is one of the less developed in Chicago. Just hop on the train and head wherever you want. Kathleen and Craig are just great people. 
4505,"My daughter and I visited Chicago right after New Year's 2014 ! Craig & Kathleen were very friendly and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and the best it could be.  It had snowed a lot just before we got there and they had completely shoveled out the sidewalks.  Their place is really large  and has 10 foot ceilings giving an added sense of space.  I can totally see how they carry the ""Frendliest.  Most Reviews"" designation.

4505,"Craig welcomed us into his house which is right next to the train station and very easy to find. The location is ideal and within 25 minutes you are downtown Chicago.

The house is very nicely decorated and has everything you need.

Everything was very clean as well.

I visited Chicago with four friends and we had a wonderful time here!"
4505,"A wonderful first trip to Chicago! A gracious and inviting host - I wish we had more time to talk! Warm and well kept, staying here during the winter weather was relaxing and comfortable, as if coming back to your own home. I look forward to stopping through again.

Thanks, Craig!"
4505,I have stayed in a lot of airbandb places int he last 9 months and this one lives up to its name as the Friendliest. Craig was keen to make our stay pleasant not just on the first day but throughout the week I and four others stayed. Its not just turning up on day one with fruit and milk and bagels but the daily dropping of of the New York Times and time for an evening beer that make it such a great experience. The place has a homely idiosyncratic feel with Craig's photos oif Chicago all over the walls.(Thanks Craig - i love the one of the taxi :-) Practicalities - its about a 30min ride on the pink line to the loop which is so close tot he apartment you hardly need to get out of bed. The neighborhood is lively with nearby fast food and a really nice supermarket within easy walking distance. Even if Chicago is not the number one destination in the world this should be your number one airbandb. See you next time Craig.
4505,"We had wonderful stay at the Perry's place. The apartment was more spacious than we expected and offered everything we needed. The Perrys even offered fresh fruit and breakfast breads. How nice! We parked our car in their garage and used public transportation during our stay. 
The ""L"" was very convenient and a few restaurants were within walking distance. The Perrys provided recommendations for other restaurants in the area we found to be charming and the food delicious.
We will be back!"
4505,"A nice place to be in windy city. Craig is a very interesting and nice person. The fridge was full with coke, bagels, juice and cream cheese. OK - the appartment is not so quiet - because of the trains - but you are close to the metro and you can jump on the pink line within a second. We enjoyed a wonderful time in chicago. So I would recommend the appartment for travelers and backpackers. For families with little children it might be to noisy inside. Thanks for having us! We will be back!"
4505,"Appartement d'une belle surface, et trÃ¨s agrÃ©able dans lequel on se sent bien. Juste Ã  cotÃ© du mÃ©tro et d'un grand supermarchÃ©. Si vous souffrez du bruit, il est a noter que la ligne de train est trÃ¨s proche mais aprÃ¨s de grandes ballades dans Chicago l'endormissement est facilitÃ©. L'accueil et la gentillesse de Graig et Kathleen sont un vrai plaisir, on prendra plaisir Ã  revenir "
4505,"Nice place. Very comfortable.
Very convenient.
Had some free fruit and bread!
The noise might be a problem for those who have sleeping problems, but we had no trouble sleeping."
4505,"Great hosts and spacious and clean apartment!  Very close to the elevated train stop.  We were able to get to the loop (downtown Chicago) in about 15 minutes.  Fresh fruit and bagels provided and Craig graciously allowed us to keep our car in their garage.  An excellent price!

The house is in Mexican town, and a little rough - as a girl, I would probably not walk alone at night (my fiancÃ© was with me) - but very safe if you are just going from the station to the house.  "
4505,"A terrific place, with wonderful hosts -- thoughtful, considerate, and very helpful to first-time visitors to Chcago. The convenience to public transit is fabulous, and the apartment is lovely: original wood floors, big bay window, a very workable kitchen, and a lovely patio where we had morning coffee in the June sunshine. I was later told by a native Chicagoan that we should not walk around that neighborhood at night, but I don't actually know if that's true. In our 5-day visit, weg had no problems."
4505,Wonderful hosts. Very easy to contact and meet. They let us use their garage for thr car which is definitely a plus for chicago. Apartment is very conveniently located by the L.Basic but with everything travellers need. The apartment is big so it was no problem when the 6 of us stayed there. Thank you so much!
4505,"Our hosts were wonderful!  They were very knowledgeable of the area and from the very first moment made us feel welcome.  The apartment was on the main floor of an older home with amazing character in a Hispanic community.  Craig is a photographer so the apartment is adorned with some amazing portraits which certainly added character.  The apartment is very close to a mass transit station and one would expect there to be a great deal of noise, as a result; however, it went unnoticed during our stay.  

"
4505,"Fantastic apartment, fantastic hosts. Craig and Kathleen were hugely accommodating and very welcoming when we arrived in Chicago. The apartment is beautifully decorated and very spacious, we would happily have spent much more time here. Highly recommended."
4505,"Wonderful place and great hosts! Location was superb, being right off the metro with easy access to downtown. Craig was very considerate and worked with me to find a check in time and a check out time that worked on my schedule.  Nice beds, nice place - perfect for a trip to Chicago!"
4505,Craig was a fantastic host. He responded quickly and was very accessible when we were at is apartment. His apartment is very nice and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Craig!
4505,Great place to stay. Host is very friendly and accommodating.
4505,"Craig and Kathleen seem to be wonderful people. Their response is very prompt and informative when inquiring about the place. And their humor is right up my alley too. I actually put up some colleagues at their place, I myself did not stay there, but they all mentioned how lovely the accommodation itself was. And if you have a car, Craig will even let you use the garage (automatic door opener clicker included! ;))."
4505,"Craig was an incredibly gracious host who was very thoughtful and always made sure we were well taken care of.  The apartment was very quaint and had more than enough of the things we needed (towels, soap, sheets, you name it!) We really enjoyed our stay in Chicago - the Pink line is right across the street so transportation is extremely accessible to downtown, if you are tourists like us. "
4505,"The location is very convenient and perfect! The interior design is lovely. Thank you for allowing us to take one of your photos, and signed for us :) Thank you for letting us parked in your garage, and let the car stay till 6 at the last day. The bed were very comfortable. "
4505,Craig is a super nice host. We enjoyed staying in the lovely apartment.
4505,"This was an awesome experience! Location right next to the Pink line was perfect. The space was clean, well maintained, and very cozy. And of course, Craig was a super gracious host. I would definitely stay here again."
4505,Craig is very accommodating.  The apartment is such a large space for a great price and beautifully decorated!  Parking multiple cars was a great ease as well.  I would definitely stay here again!
4505,The apartment was exactly as described.  Hosts were friendly and interesting.  Have NO reservations about your reservation.  Highly reccomend
4505,"This is the second time we've stayed here so we kind of knew our way around the apartment. Craig met us at the door when we got there. He let us use the garage to park our car for the weekend and made sure we still knew where everything was and how to use all of his stuff. There were two Ventra cards waiting for us so we didn't have to buy our own and since he was fighting a pretty bad cold, he just gave us breakfast money instead of buying food for us for the next morning. Nice touches as usual!

The beds are pretty comfortable and the apartment itself is clean and nice to come home to after a day of running around Chicago. Nothing is off limits since this apartment is exclusively for airbnb guests. It's got all the necessities (sheets, blankets, pillows, towels, shampoo, soap, microwave, fridge/freezer, stove, dish soap) and amenities like a cork screw, a regular coffee pot and a french press! There is cable and internet if you find yourself staying in one night (we did because we had our 6 month old with us and she goes to bed early). And the pink line train which goes downtown is literally RIGHT across the street. One of the reasons I picked this apartment the first time we stayed. Craig is really nice and helpful. He's always available if you need to ask him anything!"
4505,"Craig & Kathleen are great hosts and smart, entertaining, and friendly people. They clearly have worked very hard to make their space welcoming and accommodating. The space is large, light, and well decorated with Craig's photography. The kitchen is perfect for those who like to cook on vacation; coffee snobs will love the multiple brewing methods available (yay!). They have all your basic needs covered like dish soap, shampoo (discovered a new favorite shampoo there), and the softest bath towels ever. 

The location is awesome, just a couple of doors from a cta station and multiple bus lines (public transit in Chicago is great we didn't use a car at all and went all over the city). There are also restaurants and groceries within easy walking distance.

We would highly recommend staying here."
4505,"Really enjoyed staying with Craig and Kathleen. Although we never met Kathleen during our stay, Craig spent time making us feel comfortable and welcome, learned about us and our trip and gave great recommendations and even left newspaper articles at the door for us with tips specific to our trip (we came for the marathon, and some sightseeing). 

Would recommend staying with Craig and Kathleen while you're in Chicago. The apartment (feels more like a small house) has a great vintage feel to it (we loved the record player) and is covered in unique photos of Chicago. They stocked the kitchen with all the coffee, tea and fresh fruit we could want and even had milk, bagels and cream cheese, and OJ waiting in the fridge for us.

Plenty of space for up to 6, even 8 people and you literally walk out the door to the train station that's a 20-25 min ride to the loop. Also walking distance to a grocery store and a great park where I got in my last few runs before the marathon. 

Bottom line, friendly and very hospitable hosts with a great apartment in a convenient location. "
4505,"Once again we had a wonderful stay at Craig and Kathleen's , we were greeted on our first day with a warm welcome and our hosts took us to the new brewery / bar and treated us to a lovely meal and a variety of beers. Craig and Kathleen go the extra mile to ensure their guests are comfortable and supply lots of information on the Chicago area, we will be back again.
"
4505,"We had a great stay in Chicago.  Craig was always very fast at responding to any of our questions and was very accommodating. Towels, sheets, pillows were all very clean. He also let us use his garage to park our rental car in. "
4505,"We all had a wonderful time on our trip to Chicago for Thanksgiving and Craig & Kathleen's was the perfect place to stay! The location is perfect - it's right by the CTA which is a great way to get around and trains run frequently to the city. The apartment is really nicely decorated and has everything you need, including a full kitchen which was useful for our attempt at Thanksgiving dinner. Craig was really welcoming and made us feel at home. Would definitely stay again!"
4505,"Great time at Craig's place. Very easy to get around with metro line right outside the house and an Uber rides always just a few minutes away. Love the brewery and brew pub right a few blocks away. Excellent little Mexican bakery just around the corner and down the main drag. Great breakfast places just a metro stop or two away. Heads-up, trains run close by, can be noisy at first but you get used to them super quick. Thanks Craig! "
4505,"We enjoyed staying with Craig and Kathleen, it's a pretty cool place from which to explore Chicago. There is plenty of room to move about - we both like a little privacy to think and write, and appreciated the several rooms to share, with all the facilities on offer ... even fifteen or so different flavours of tea to taste and enjoy, and the thoughtful, huge basket of fruit provided for us. We didn't see much of Kathleen, who had appointments in New York and Boston during our stay, but Craig was generous with his time, took us to the local supermarket which though only ten minutes walk away, has a couple of twists and turns enroute so we appreciated his thoughtfulness. The supermarket, by the way, is a big one with plenty of Mexican specialties in the fruit and vegie department. The apartment is literally a stone's throw from a railway station, from there it's 20 - 25 minutes into the city  We'd love to go back.."
4505,"This Airbnb accommodation is truly great! Our host, Craig, was there to welcome us when we arrived, explained us all the necessary things and then took us to a brewery close by. He even paid for the beer, which was very kind and we had a good chitchat while drinking it. The accommodation itself is very spacious, the six of us fitted well in the four double beds. Everything, including the kitchen and the bathroom is in a very good condition. We were even provided with fresh fruits, bagels and cream cheese. The neighborhood is, like the accommodation, great. The main sight is definitely the brewery, which I would recommend everyone to visit who stays with Craig and Kathleen. We also found a wonderful Mexican restaurant just five minutes from the accommodation, were we had great fun and good food. And of course, the pink line train station is literally opposite the accommodation (and the train just takes about 15 minutes to get downtown). So overall, staying in Craig and Kathleen's accommodation as a small group when visiting Chi Town is a very wise choice!"
4505,We had an amazing time. The house was right next to the metro which is the most important thing in chicago specially so we had to spend less time travelling. Since we were new to the city Craig showed us different spots around the city that we should go to and helped us a lot with the maps.
4505,Craig and Kathleen's place was great! It was very convenient--right off the train--and had plenty of space for three people. They even had milk in the fridge and cream cheese for bagels! Really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again.
4505,"Craig is a very cool and welcoming host. Even set us up with bagels, juice, and beer. We were in town for a conference and the super close access to the train was awesome. Place was very comfy."
4505,"Craig and Kathleen's place is exactly how an AirBnB should be! From the minute we arrived, Craig made us feel welcome with food in the fridge; tea, coffee, herbs and spices in the cupboards; and a clean and cosy apartment. 

The place was exactly as listed and the area is great. A mainly Mexican neighbourhood - there's plenty to eat and food shopping is easy enough if you want to do your own cooking. If you're a beer fan, the Lagunitas brewery and taproom is 10 minutes walk from the apartment serving great beer and food in a really quirky space. Not to be missed!

The house is less than a minute to the train into the city. Even at rush hour, we were able to get into the loop in 20 minutes - riding the whole way above ground with excellent views!

The apartment is separate from Craig and Kathleen's but they are never far away if you need anything. It's great to feel free in a new city, in the knowledge that you're not totally alone. On our last day, Craig took us for a few holes of golf in the local park before we left for the airport.

Craig and Kathleen take their role as ambassadors for the city seriously, suggesting a whole host of places to drink and eat from a seemingly endless list of their favourites (ask them to point you in the direction of their city-view hotel bars - they really rival the views of the over-hyped Hancock bar and with far better ambiance). These are the kind of tips that you can only get from locals, and this, for me, is the reason to use AirBnB. Craig and Kathleen are an incredibly laid back and friendly couple who were able to make a strange city feel like home for 10 days. We cannot recommend this apartment highly enough!"
4505,"Excellent place to stay! We had a great time here, location is right next to a train station. We took a taxi from Midway airport to here and that cost about $15, and you can catch Uber cars into the downtown area for $10-15 as well. Highly recommended!"
4505,"Our stay in Chicago was awesome. Craig and the two resident animals were extremely inviting, and the apartment was spotless. It is a bit more off of the beaten path, but that's why we liked it! We only had three guests but there is plenty of room for eight, and we were seconds from the train to downtown. Will visit again."
4505,Very nice experience. Hope to stay next time. We got a very nice welcome. 
4505,"I loved everything about staying at Craig and Kathleens's place. They were very welcoming. The apartment is extremely comfortable and spacious; 7 of us were comfortable. The apartment had all the necessities and more. Also, Raymond's taco place on 22nd was awesome and in walking distance. Bottom line, great space, great host, great experience."
4505,"Craig and Kathleen's place is exactly as described! Additionally from the minute you arrive, Craig makes you feel welcome and like at home.

The house is less than a minute to the train into the city and you are able to get into the loop in 20 minutes - including excellent views.

On our first day Craig took us to the brewery and afterwards we sat in the garden and shared stories and laughter.

Craig ist not only a great host, but also a superb ambassador for Chicago and the United States."
4505,"Staying with Craig (and Kathleen, though she was traveling during our stay) was a highlight of our year. I won't repeat what everyone else here has said, but will remark that every positive review I have read (and I didn't see any negative ones!) was spot on.  Yes, the apartment is nice and the location is great, but the atmosphere of hospitality and friendliness and true care is what makes this place special. We were a group of five, ranging in age from my nephew (26) to my mother-in -law (81). All of our needs were met and exceeded. We will return...the sooner the better. Thanks, Craig."
4505,"Craig was great. He communicated well and was there waiting for us when we arrived. the apartment was quite nice. He had fruit, bagels, milk, and orange juice waiting for us. The apartment is right across from the train which made it easy to get into the city. "
4505,"Both the space and the host were very congenial.  We were a family of five with three young adults and there was plenty of room and lots of compliments on the accommodations.  Our 30 year old, whose birthday we were celebrating with a trip to Chicago, said she much preferred staying here to some fancy hotel room.

Train noise is definitely part of the experience but our kids used earplugs and slept fine.  All of us would happily stay there again."
4505,"As soon as my group and I arrived we were warmly greeted by Craig along with Aaron the cat and Mr. Sanchez the dog (who we both love btw). Craig was super helpful in orienting us to our new home for the few days we had  and giving us tips on where and how to go abouts the city. The main thing we regret is not visiting the brewery by the house like Craig suggested (our plans didn't coincide with the times of the brewery), so that means we'll just have to come back to see it for ourselves. 

The listing was just as described and full of character and beautiful photos taken by Craig. Everything was in working order and there were plenty of amenities available to us. We loved the Brio game. We never had any issues during our stay and felt quite comfortable with our home away from home. The sounds of the trains never bothered me and I didn't have any complaints from my group about the noise either. Craig left us with plenty of fruits and yogurt which we are very thankful for!  There's a grocery store nearby but we never had to go out for extra snacks since we had the food Craig provided and the snacks we bought during the day around the city.

The train station is right beside the place so it was very convenient with travelling via train. (Hidden by Airbnb) maps would estimate a 35min travel time to the core of downtown but we'd actually get there in (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) min. 

Overall, our stay at Craig and Kathleen's place was exactly what we needed while we were in Chicago. Thank you for making us feel welcomed and at home here :) "
4505,"Had a great time.  Craig was helpful and the elevated train station is right across the street, super convenient."
4505,"Craig is the best host you will ever meet. He is very friendly, helpful and cooperative. If you want to know what Airbnb offer as experience, Craig's house will give it to you. You can see their work and images in the walls inspired by Chicago life. If you look for quiet neighborhood, this is not the one. Because this house is for people who want to explore the city. You have a train station next to you and very active neighborhood."
4505,"This apartment is spectacular!! Beautifully decorated, super clean, and plenty of old world charm.  Craig was a wonderful host!  He made sure  we had everything we needed, and even brought in some orange juice, bagels, and yogurt.  And the tea selection!  Fantastic.  The host pets (cat & dog) were adorable as well.

The el station is directly across the street.  How often does the train go by?  So often you won't even notice it. :)  The garage parking is an added bonus, for no extra charge.  We parked and didn't take the car out again until we left. 

I highly recommend staying with Craig & Kathleen.  They are very knowledgable about the city and happy to give recommendations.   I will definitely be checking to see if the unit is available anytime I need a few nights stay in Chicago."
4505,"Craig nam de telefoon op, ook Kathleen binnen redelijke termijn.
We hadden van te voren een maal contact."
4505,Craig was a very welcoming and generous host. He was there to greet us when we arrived and helped us carry stuff in. Very personable. The house is perfect - my 14 month old approved of the indoor and outdoor spaces. Didn't even need to baby proof. We enjoyed coffee/breakfast every morning outside (felt very fancy about it too with the French press provided). The pink line train is. right. there. But you barely notice the noise inside and it whizzes by so fast that if you're chatting outside you only have to pause for a few seconds. Loved the location. Loved the amenities (donkey milk soap! bagels! soft bedding! free parking... in the garage!). Loved Craig's flexibility. They live above the airbnb but we didn't feel like we were intruding on them with our comings and goings.. At least we hope we didn't. You really couldn't find a better deal or more comfortable accommodations in a fancy schmancy hotel. Thanks for an awesome stay!
4505,"We had an excellent time at Craig and Kathleen's airbnb.  The unit was clean, spacious, and comfortable.  Also included was  a lovely patio and yard for morning coffee.  We found anything we could possibly need as travelers available to us. Craig and Kathleen were friendly, kind and available for questions.
The neighborhood was interesting with street vendors serving up fresh fruit cocktails, elotes, and icecream.  
Transportation was super convenient with the pink line right next door.  (train)  Mostly we utilized the train to get to the loop, and at times  connect to another train or bus.  A few  times we Ubered back to the unit from downtown Chicago and the fair was ten to twelve dollars.  For a party of three that was economical as well.
Certainly we would enjoy the opportunity to stay here again.  Thank you both for being so helpful and kind.  Regards as well to Mr Sanchez and Aaron!"
4505,"We had a fabulous time in this great apartment. The space was perfect for our family group of 5 (including 3 teenagers) and the place is equipped with everything you might need for a short break. The location is also ideal, being steps away from the L, meaning you can be downtown in 20 minutes or so. Craig and Kathleen were the perfect hosts - attentive to all our needs without being intrusive, including generously taking us out to the local brewery on our first evening. In short, if you are thinking about booking this place, just do it - you won't regret it!"
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were very welcoming. Craig met us and went over all the local attractions. He even picked up some groceries for us before we arrived. Super convenient, right in front of the train station."
4505,Craig is very nice! The apartment is very comfortable. Very close to the pink line!It's wonderful to live here!
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were terrific hosts-very welcoming, flexible, and accommodating and the place itself was fantastic.  It was well stocked with extra linen, soaps, and they had even stocked the fridge with breakfast items.  
With that being said, the neighborhood itself was pretty undesirable.  We had the unfortunate pleasure of driving a little bit past the block that the place was located on, and it got really scary really quickly.  The block that the residence is located on is okay, but I probably still wouldn't walk there much after dark.  
So in summary, great space but not great place. "
4505,Craig and Kathleen are great hosts! We stayed in their place for 12 days and when we left it felt like leaving home. After exploring Chicago all day long it is great it only takes a 20 seconds walk from the pink line  platform to the front door. There is a great freshmarket nearby and a great Brewery within walking distance!
4505,Craig went out of his way to make us all feel welcome.  Even meeting two different groups as we arrived.  He was a great host and was around much of the time to make sure expectations were met.   He was accommodating to allow us a late checkout.   Great location near the train to get anywhere in the city.  You may even be tempted to just sit in his courtyard with a book.
4505,"First experience with Airbnb, and first vacation in Chicago. Craig and Kathleen were wonderful hosts. Craig met us on the day we arrived and took us out to the local neighborhood brewery. The brewery folks knew Craig well and he took care of the tab (really nice of him). The apartment itself was pretty solid. Everything was clean, worked properly, and was comfortable. It was decorated with Craig's artwork (he is a photographer), and he even let us take home a print. The photos are mostly from in and around Chicago so it gave us a nice feel for the city. Craig also had the apartment stocked with milk, juice, bagels, fruit, tea, and coffee, we didn't need to go out for breakfast once (A huge plus when you want to get an early start exploring the city). The best part about this place is it is literally steps from pink line train. You can walk to the train in less than a minute and go anywhere in the city. 5/5 Would definitely stay here again. The apartment also has a garage you can park your car in if you drive to the city.

P.S. Craig added a really nice touch. He found out it was my birthday week, and one night we came home to find a cake and some candles. A+"
4505,"Perfect hosts! Craig was very helpful in every matter we had. The visit of the near local brewery was great. He even picked up some groceries for us before we arrived. Super convenient, right in front of the Pink line train station. Thank you, Craig!"
4505,"Our hosts were absolutely wonderful. We didn't get a chance to meet Kathleen during our stay, but Craig is warm, flexible, welcoming and very accommodating. Craig is very responsive and helpful when the crew of guests were wandering around after our bus dropped us off, and gave us awesome suggestions for nearby food before we even met him. The location is right next to the train station which was amazing for the group of us, students, who needed to get to multiple places in the city each day. Craig also highly recommended we check out the Lagunita's brewery just a block or two down the street. It was an absolute gem of a place to have right next door; quirky, fun, great food, friendly people, awesome space. Craig's pup, Mr. Sanchez was a wonderful delight and comfort to come home to. There are photographs on the walls, breakfast food stocked in the fridge, extra sheets or towels by the plenty; everything made us feel so at home, and so at ease during the relatively hectic trip we had planned for ourselves.
Many of us in the group have saved this little treasure of a spot as a place we'd love to stay in again. 
And I know many of us also would come back to Chicago just to stop by, say hi, and maybe grab a nice brew with Craig! Overall, a 10/10 experience :) "
4505,"Todo perfecto! El grupo estuvo comodo. Los anfitriones super amables. La casa muy comoda. El barrio no es tan centrico, pero se llega facilmente y queda cerca de todo. Gracias. Recomendable!"
4505,"The host is so nice and we had a great time, thx"
4505,We were very happy with our stay. There was plenty of room and comfort in the appt. We would gladly stay there again.
4505,Craig and Kathleen were so welcoming to our group! They were very accommodating and truly cared about our stay.
4505,"It was a great house. As described online. We had breakfast (coffee, tea, bagels, cream cheese, milk, orange juice...) Everything was super clean. Easy access to the city."
4505,"Great space! Stayed warm and enjoyed the very comfy beds. Some are firm and others are soft, so you can pick whichever suits you. Craig was very nice and made us feel right at home. Loved the shower!! The water stayed hot throughout my long showers. Everything was clean and comfortable."
4505,"It was a wonderful experience to have two nights stay in this house with my friends. I arrived first and found that Craig selected a famous Chinese movie to welcome us, which surprised me a lot. The arrangement in the house is exactly the same as the picture shows. I love it! And the house is located near the pink line, which makes travels to downtown very convenient. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. It is a good choice for visitors."
4505,"It was a very good stay, very friendly host! The house was nice and classic styled, witch made our experience even better."
4505,"Good experience. Host is very nice. Is very convenient, just locate next by metro. Also the host give us each one a very good photos in the end. That is awesome. "
4505,"Thanks to our gracious hosts, my friends and I had a spectacular home away from home! We shipped up to Chicago for my bachelor weekend  and we were very lucky to find such an amazing place to stay. The hosts, the dog, the warm and cozy atmosphere, the original photographs on the walls, the mind-blowing brewery nearly right next door, the CTA stop across the street. I could go on and on with reasons why this is an elite AirBnB. In addition, he was very understanding when I, like a loser, forgot to count myself in our group number. He didn't make it seem as if I was trying to slip one by him and we worked it out. 

Seriously, if you're looking for a great stay just outside of downtown, book it. If you're looking for a great stay inside downtown, consider booking this one anyway. There will be no regrets."
4505,"Craig was a wonderful host. He was very flexible with our check in and made us feel right at home.

The place itself is awesome. Plenty of space if you have a small group. There were 4 ppl in ours and it never felt uncomfortable or crowded. The pink line is steps away which made getting around that much easier.

Definitely recommend staying at Craig and Kathleen's rental if you are looking for a place in Chicago!"
4505,"The space was clean and conveniently located just steps from the train. It is also walking distance to a very cool brewery. The host communicated well and left us orange juice, fruit, bagels...also had plenty of towels and other amenities. I was concerned about train noise but we didn't even hear the train very much while inside.  Also very cool photographic art on the walls.  If you're not used to urban city living, though, it can be intimidating at first; however, we didn't have any problems. "
4505,"This is a cozy home, and we got everything we need. The house has a wonderful location, we can get to the pink line within 2 mins! Also, I love his artworks, and he is a really nice person. Great memory in Chicago! Highly recommend!!! "
4505,very great experience! So nice the house and host. Five stars!
4505,"Our night in Chicago was amazing! The house was great, the bed was comfortable, and it is right by the train to go into the city, making the location perfect. Craig met us at the door and showed us around the place. He was friendly and had gone above and beyond to make sure that we were comfortable, even going as far as stocking the fridge with snacks and breakfast supplies. This was our first time in an Airbnb, and I could not have asked for a better experience. If you are going to Chicago, this is the place to stay!"
4505,"Craig & Kathleen were the best hosts I've had for Airbnb! They waited for us to arrive the Friday we flew in and welcomed us with some wine & beer. We greatly enjoyed our chats with them and hearing about their life in Chicago and receiving recommendations. The train station is literally across the street from the house so it is very convenient to walk over and hop on! It's about a 20 minute ride into the city, and about the same time in a Lyft/Uber, which was anywhere from $15-30 (depending on traffic, surge pricing, and we also requested Uber XL or Lyft Plus because we had 5 people).

The house itself was very well decorated and had everything we needed! We were a little nervous beforehand because we had 5 girls and there is only 1 bathroom, but there were 2 additional mirrors so we had no issues with all of us getting ready at the same time. Craig's photos of Chicago were awesome decoration and the beds were all comfortable! They provided some breakfast snacks - yogurt, bagels, fruit, as well as coffee and tea that was very much appreciated!

All in all, it was a great stay with fantastic hosts!"
4505,It's cozy place and easy commute to city. Craig was a great host. The apartment has everything we need. We would definitely stay there again. 
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were thoughtful and friendly hosts and we liked them both a lot.  Six of us came for a UC graduation and we couldn't have been happier with the house, which is right across the street from the elevated air-conditioned train to downtown (20 -25 minutes?).  The hosts live on the upper floor with a separate entrance and our ground floor was well equipped (good teas, soaps, things in the fridge, etc.), well air-conditioned and sports three full BR (one is in a large separate room but the bed is beautifully curtained off; the other two are separate (one queen, one with 2 queens and both with doors).  They have a lovely yard/garden with a BBQ and chairs for having a drink with or without them.  The neighborhood is mostly hispanic and quite decent with a superb supermarket  and a huge Lagunitas Brewpub in walking distance.  We'd go again in a minute and very much enjoyed spending a bit of time with the hosts.  A model airbnb."
4505,"Excellent place, right-next to train station. We got a warm welcome from Craig and his dog. His snaps in the wall from around the city were awesome decoration and beds were all comfortable. He did let us park our car in his garage and also welcomed us with fruits, snacks and drinks and the place was nice and clean. It was very generous of him to let me choose one of his photo from wall, which is the best souvenir I have ever had. Me and my friends are definitely going back."
4505,Everything was great. A really convenient location next to California L-station.  The welcoming items were much appreciated. Communications with hosts were excellent and we would definitely stay here again. Thanks so much 
4505,"The housing situation was very nice. Four full/queen sized beds was perfect for our 4-person golf trip to Chicago. This Airbnb had all the amenities as a hotel: towels, soap, plates, etc. They were even nice enough to provide us with orange juice, yogurt, and bagels! We were allowed to park our large van on the driveway, so we had no issues with parking. The housing and its amenities were awesome. 

The location of this house is in a prime spot for bars and breweries. It is right next to Lagunita's Brewery. If you do not go to this establishment, you will regret it!! Also, we would recommend Piece Pizzera and Brewery. It is only a 10 minute drive from the house. 

I would second a previous commenters thoughts on the environment around the house. It is city living to the truest sense with a diverse culture, which we did NOT view as a negative aspect of this Airbnb. However, if you aren't expecting that, it may surprise you. As for our group, we always felt at ease when staying at this establishment.

We really enjoyed our time and would use this place again!!

"
4505,"A group of us (3 couples) stayed at Craig and Kathleen's for a few days because of a wedding we were attending in Chicago. From the first communication, Craig was responsive to my request. When we arrived, he greeted us and was patient when the airport had delays and we were later than expected. He greeted us with beer and offered to take us to the nearby Lagunitas Brewery (a short walk--highly recommend going!). We appreciated his immediate hospitality. 

The home is next to a train station and a short drive from downtown in a primarily hispanic neighborhood. We were allowed to park our car in the driveway, and felt comfortable doing so as long as no valuables were inside. The house is decorated nicely, clean, and spacious. The train was loud for the light sleepers in our group, so I'd recommend using headphones if you're a light sleeper. It's a small price to pay for the convenient location!

I would recommend this home to friends, and would consider staying here in the future. Thanks to the hosts for contributing to a fabulous trip!"
4505,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. Is now my go to place for Chicago shenanigans. House was more than ample for all seven of us, and easy access to the trains was amazing. Can't recommend enough, Craig is a superstar."
4505,"Great host! Had some bagels and fruit for us for breakfast in the fridge when we got there, and provided lots of pamphlets on things to do in Chicago.  "
4505,"We had an amazing time at Craig and Kathleen's place! The interior of the apartment was spacious, clean, and equipped with everything we needed for our stay. The yard was a nice bonus as well, we found ourselves making use of the patio furniture quite frequently. The house has a ton of character and was obviously decorated by the awesome artists who own it! Location was great, easy access to public transit or a quick drive downtown. If all of that wasn't good enough, the owners are great people! Craig went out of his way to make sure that we enjoyed our stay (that included staying up until 3am to let us in after our flight was delayed). Such a great experience, I would recommend this place to anyone looking in Chicago! We will definitely be back! Thanks again for everything!"
4505,"We had an awesome stay. The house was plenty spacious for 4 adults and 2 kids. The house has plenty of character that we loved. 

Craig is a gracious host. He had bagels, cream cheese, fruit, juice, milk and yogurt ready for our arrival. 

We spent a lot of time on the porch. On a side note, the brick wall behind the front porch makes for a great backdrop to take pictures and selfies in particular.

The location is central to downtown Chicago. You can take the side roads( 15 mins ride) to get to magnificent mile.

The Lagunitas brewery is within walking distance and they have really good beer.

This house exudes a certain calmness that is very hard to describe. After a crazy day in downtown Chicago, it sure was nice to just kick back and relax at this house.

We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back at this rental next time we are in Chicago.

"
4505,"We had a very good experience, great house, good location, pleasant hosts, all our needs were met, even got a nice parting gift!"
4505,"We really enjoyed our stay here.  This was by far the best hospitality we've received during any of our Airbnb stays.  The host asked us what food we liked, went straight to the grocery store, and provided us with enough for breakfast each day we were there.  He had great suggestions for places to go and things to do.  He was always available if we had questions. 

The interior is really cozy.  It has a nice kitchen, living room with cable tv, 2 bedrooms, and another sleeping area adjacent to the living room.  There are several different soaps to choose from in the bathroom, a nice touch.  There's free WiFi as well.  The back wall is covered with photographs the host has taken.  He let's you pick one to keep when you leave.  We thought that was cool.  The enclosed front porch is nice, we usually ate breakfast out there before starting our day.  The yard is large and inviting as well.  Being so close to the pink line was really convenient.  

I hope to stay here again in the future."
4505,Great place and great host! As described. Really recoment this place. 
4505,"Todo estuvo perfecto.
Muchas gracias Craig & Kathleen.
Definitivamente regresarÃ­amos de nuevo!
La ubicaciÃ³n de la casa esta perfecta ."
4505,"Super experience. Super host. The only drawback is the neighbor. However, the place is at 1 min walk distance of the subway. Downtown really close. "
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were extremely welcoming. They provided everything we needed, gave us insight to the neighborhood and things around it. Riot fest was great, but staying at Craig's was what really made the experience special. I would recommend staying here to everyone. "
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were amazing hosts, and their home is gorgeous.  The stay during Riot Fest was a unique and fantastic one and so glad we got to stay there and experience it.
The area is very cool to poke around and just a couple of blocks from a great brewery and park and their home is just steps from transit (Pink Line).
I would highly recommend them as hosts!"
4505,"I really can't say enough good things about our stay with Craig and Kathleen; Everything was absolutely fantastic. Next time we are in Chicago, we will definitely be staying with them. Frankly, the place was so cool, we didn't want to leave to go explore the city."
4505,Great trip. Great hosts. We had a great time
4505,"Craig and Kathleen are the most accommodating, caring, and attentive hosts you could ever hope to have. They leave nothing left to want for and did everything within their power to ensure that my stay was more than pleasant. I honestly can not say enough nice things about this reservation.  I very much hope to see Craig again. 
Make sure that you ask him about his pumpkins."
4505,Good host and good times...-a very interesting way to experience riot fest.  Well done first round; I'm sure next year will be even better!
4505,Craig and Kathleen are some of the nicest people that I have ever met. They were there to offer us advice on the city and take care of any needs that we expressed to them. I had an amazing experience staying with them and would highly recommend! 
4505,"We had a great stay at Craig's and Kathleen's place. Craig is very easy going, attentionate and helpful. The house is very spacious, perfect for 7 people and very very close to the subway station. The area is a bit noisy and there are not a lot of shops and restaurants around but it was ok since we were most of the time in the city. It is a very good deal for groups of friends or big families."
4505,"A Wonderful experience in Chicago. The house is clean and tidy, although it's an old house. Craig is a passionate host. He helped us a lot. "
4505,Host was amazing and really welcoming and accommodating. I would for sure book again and recommend anyone to stay here. 
4505,"We had an awesome time at Craig and Kathleen's place! We had initial reservations about the safety of the neighbourhood however Craig made us feel ok about the hood and he was right we felt super safe and happy being in Little Village. Chicago is awesome and we'd love to come back another time! Craig was a lovely host providing us with fruit, train tickets (to charge up), bagels and we even got a lovely framed photo to take home as a memory!"
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were spectacular hosts! Super hospitable, accommodating people who truly value their place and their community. They were so friendly and interesting (both artists), and gave me so many tips on the location, neighborhoods of Chicago to check out for my intended purpose and things to do in the area, including a hidden gem, Lagunitas Brewery. I highly recommend this very cool brewery experience. If you do the tour, ask for Katie. She is a fantastic guide. I would definitely stay with Craig and Kathleen again if I were looking for a reasonably priced place in Chicago. It is a bit removed from downtown, but public transit is right across the street, it's about 12 to 15 minutes to downtown, and taking a Lyft from downtown at night was quick and only between $12 and $16 per ride. The area is ethnically diverse, which I always find interesting. Don't expect Starbucks on every corner. Do expect some of the best craft brew in the country at Lagunitas. :) I was told Heart of Italy, with several Italian restaurants, is close by, but I didn't have time to check it out. If you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs, as you can hear the trains going by at night, except for early Sunday mornings. Craig and Kathleen's place is very comfortable and inviting, complete with fruit, yogurt and coffee when you arrive! It is an older house with plenty of character, including nice art: Craig's photos. He is a photographer and has a good eye for capturing local flavor. Mr. Sanchez, their dog, was a sweetheart, usually hanging out on the stoop to greet me. :) Thanks again for a wonderful stay, Craig, Kathleen and Mr. Sanchez!"
4505,"This was a fantastic space!  Very clean, organized, and well-maintained.  "
4505,Craig and Kathleen's place was clean with plenty of space for our group of 4. Very convenient being right across the street from the Pink line. Would definitely stay here again!
4505,"We really enjoyed our stay. The host is a photographer. The house is full of his works. Very clean and cozy place. Even breakfast was provided. Bagel, orange juice, milk and all kinds of drinks. Very recommend!!"
4505,"This place is quite awesome if you and your friends are more than 4. They have 4 queen beds, very clean and cosy. The host is also very nice. I left my laptop charger in his house and went back to Michigan. I contacted him and he is very pleasant to send that to me."
4505,"Craig and Kathleen's place was great! Although we weren't able to stay given a family emergency, I know for a fact it would have been great had we'd been given the opportunity to stay. Craig was fantastic with communication prior to booking as well as after. Once we arrived, he provided a detour of the place. Explaining where things were in the house, when to park, how to lock up, etc. He even gave us some tips for travelling within the city. Craig had also provided fresh fruit, juice and candy to munch on during our stay. 5 stars would be an understatement...This place is definitely a 5+ stay. It was very clean, spacious and comfortable. There were 4 beds and an option for a pull out couch. Very close to the train  and other places (bars, food, etc).  Hopefully next time we can actually enjoy our travels. Thank you again Craig! "
4505,"These are good people, they will go above and beyond to make sure you have a good time :)"
4505,"My staying was perfect. Everything is just as described. The station is really close, you just need to cross the street, and to me, the noise wasn't really disturbing at all.
Craig and Kathleen were very kind, we found the apartment in perfect conditions.
I suggest this place. Go visit the Lagunitas brewery! It's very close to the apartment and it's worth it."
4505,"Where to begin describing this wonderful experience?!?!?! Craig and Kathleen's place is EVEN BETTER than the pics suggest. It is extremely spacious with lots of room, and there are plenty of extra sheets, towels, and other goodies left around the house. (Thank you for the free coffee and snacks!!!). The beds are VERY comfortable and clean. I didn't get to meet Kathleen, but Craig was super accommodating with our delay at check-in and was wonderful to talk to. His pets, Aaron and Mr. Sanchez, are very friendly and like to say hello. There are a ton of guidebooks and pamphlets in the apartment so you can do some reading about anything you could possibly want to do in Chicago! And lastly, Craig's beautiful art really makes this place special!!! I 100% recommend this for groups of young travellers looking for a cool and affordable place to stay in Chicago. Don't be daunted by its distance from all those downtown attractions - it's an easy journey with cool views of the city and lots of time to chat with your friends. This is the perfect place to come home to after a long day of sightseeing. "
4505," very clean, with every thoughtful amenity provided- breakfast items, umbrellas, loads of maps and schedules and brochures, shopping bags, books, towels and pillows.
Mr Sanchez and the cat made us feel at home so we missed our own pets a little less. The train access is the best! A nice big fenced yard for watching the world. 
The bed curtains in the larger room are a creative and effective room darkener when needed. The smaller bedrooms are cozy and comfortable. Loved  being surrounded by the wonderful photos of Chicago people and places in all seasons of every day life. Craig and Sean are relaxed and welcoming hosts. "
4505,"The house itself is funky and wonderful, with lots of photographs and a fun atmosphere. It worked well for a group of 5. The location is great - next door to the L (pink line) and very close to Lagunitas. It was also very easy access from the highway and being able to access an off-street parking spot was great. 
The hosts were lovely, very responsive to messages through the AirBnB app. They live upstairs, so they were able to quickly respond to help us out when one of our group left something behind after we checked out and had locked the door behind us. They provided a variety of fruits, yogurts, coffee, milk, juice, and mini candy bars. In the bathroom, there was a variety of soaps to try. Everything was perfectly clean. We mostly only slept there, as we were out during the day/evening, but the space is good for hanging out, both in the common area of the house and outside. I would highly recommend this place and would love to stay here again the next time I am in town."
4505,We liked our stay at Craig and Kathleen's. Craig really cares whether you enjoy your stay.
4505,"Just a quick note: the apartment is diagonally across from the L station. Don't let (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps confuse you. That aside, two friends and I visited Chicago last weekend to visit a friend in nearby Pilsen. Craig and Kathleen's place was a perfect spot for us, and had all the amenities to make our long weekend comfortable and enjoyable. At the end, our only regrets were that we didn't have more time to explore the city. Thanks again, and thank you for the picture of Wrigley and Tribune towers now hanging on my wall at home. :)"
4505,"From Eva, Elodie, Joaquin and myself - we'd all like to say a massive thanks for being such an amazing host and making us feel right at home. We absolutely loved Chicago and you were a big part of that. We could not have asked for a better stay. Thanks again and all the best for the future. "
4505,"Craig & Kathleen's place is awesome! There's plenty of room, it's close to the train, and staying here feels like you're staying in the ""real"" Chicago, not just some touristy hotel in the middle of town. Craig was quite helpful with directions and offering tips on how to use the train. He even let us use his CTA passes making it easier for us to use the train. The place is comfortable, clean, cozy, and a great place to stay with wonderful hosts. "
4505,We loved staying with Kathleen and Craig. The apartment was perfect for our needs and so very well stocked with everything . Perfect place for a family stay in Chicago
4505,"Four of us stayed with Craig and Kathleen for a week of family vacation. My partner and I know Chicago very well, we've stayed multiple places, and have many favorite spots we like to visit all over the city, so we know there's basically two choices: you can stay downtown and spend quite a lot for a decent hotel just for a weekend (or a fortune for a really nice hotel), or you can stay away from downtown and stay for a week with what you would spend for a weekend downtown. So the trick is to find a nice place that has a great location and easy access to public transportation. This place fits the bill nicely! Our hosts: I mean it sincerely when I say that Craig and Kathleen are the kind of people I would love to have for nextdoor neighbors. They care deeply about their home, their property, their neighbors and neighborhood, the city of Chicago overall, and their guests. They are genuinely interested in why you have come to Chicago and what you plan to do, and Craig has all kinds of thoughtful comments on the experiences offered by Chicago. Yet he's not pushy with recommendations and loves to hear what you thought about what you discovered and what you did, and he's more than helpful if you do want ideas. He was also kind enough to help us get set up with breakfast items. The space: we had more then enough room for all four of us. A nice bright kitchen with morning sun welcomed us each day, and plenty of sleeping accommodations allowed each of our teen girls to have their own space. We sometimes got in each other's way with the single bathroom but the full-length mirror in the kitchen is a nice touch and was an even better location for the ladies to do makeup and final touches. The delightful photographs on the walls throughout are a hallmark of the character of this place. They are all the result of Craig's skilled street photography. Ask him about the backstory of any of them, such as ""The Opera"" - you'll know it when you see it. The lawn outside is enclosed, inviting, comfortable, and the best way to really get a feel for where you are staying. We enjoyed sitting outside in the evening with a cup of tea surrounded by the sounds of the city, watching the community move around us and waving to passerby. And there are a lot of people passing by since it is right next to the California station of the Pink Line. The people in this area genuinely appreciate the care and attention that Craig puts into the lawn and inviting look of the exterior. He is proud of it and it shows. It's an enviable oasis the commuters see each day. Do not miss the opportunity to enjoy spending some time outside, especially with the lovable dog Mr. Sanchez. The neighborhood: this is Little Village..."
4505,"Craig & Kathleen's place was perfect for us.  It's conveniently located a stones throw from the CTA train which allows you access to all parts of Chicago.   They provided a lot of nice little bonuses I never expected: a few things in the fridge, a clean towel for each guest.  The beds were better than expected and the 5 of us slept very comfortably (trains didn't bother anyone).  This was my first time using AirBnb and Craig made us feel very comfortable.  I know where I'll be staying in Chicago in the future!"
4505,"My sister, Dad and I had a great Father's Day weekend in Chicago at Craig and Kathleen's place. They put a lot of thought into the little touches like having fruit and milk in the fridge for you. Beds were super comfy and sheets smelled amazing! Though the location is not central to downtown, the train station is literally a 10 second walk. Thanks for a great weekend!"
4505,Awesome place! Craig was super helpful getting us checked in and meeting all our needs as a larger group of 4. The apartment was beyond our expectations in terms of sleeping all of us comfortably. I'd definitely stay here again! Highly recommended!
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were perfect hosts. Craig was quick to reply to any questions and even stayed up super late to greet us when we arrived. The space was clean and comfortable, and they left us plenty of food to bible on during our visit. I'd stay with Craig and Kathleen again the next time I come to Chicago. "
4505,"This apartment is ideal if you are traveling with a group of people who don't all want to share a bedroom. Generously sized, old building but very comfortable. It is right next to the train station, which is super convenient for getting into town, but of course also means that there's noise from the trains. The neighborhood is working-class, lively, friendly, kids playing outside - I enjoyed exploring. I was invited to an impromptu neighborhood gathering and loved meeting some local residents from all walks of life. Craig was easy to communicate with. He had stocked the kitchen with treats, fresh milk, bagels. He and Kathleen live on the upper floor, always available if needed (we had no issues). We'd stay here again!"
4505,Very close to public transportation to downtown Chicago. Not in the best neighborhood but otherwise a very beautiful home and quite spacious. The host was very accommodating and welcoming.
4505,"Our stay at Craig and Kathleen's place was great!  Everything was clean and easy.  We met Craig when we checked in, and he was a really nice guy.  This place is an exceptionally good choice if you have a lot of people or are looking for something close to public transit.  The train station is right across the street."
4505,Craig made sure our check-in was smooth even though we had delayed flights to deal with. The house itself is a great space with loads of character and is really close to public transit. The neighborhood also has some good restaurants (and Lagunitas) if you prefer to walk. Would definitely recommend.
4505,"This house has everything already provided plus it's cozy, spacious and comfortable. It is so convenient (right next to the train) and close to a park and Lagunitas.  Craig's photos are a wonderful bonus! Such a cool spot and city!"
4505,"I recommend! A nice place, close to public transportation. Craig was great to us. I hope I can stay there again in the future."
4505,Craig & Kathleen are awesome. The space is nice and clean and they are very friendly and kind. We had an awesome time and will definitely be coming back next time we stay in Chicago. 
4505,"Very convenient to the pink line CTA train

I chose this location over a hotel when traveling as an adult with three teen agers.  It is beneficial for everyone to have a little downtime and space 

A place with a kitchen and a fridge is also a savings 

Really nice Mexican bakery around the corner and if you are feeling adventurous also a tasty goat stew nearby on Cermak Ave"
4505,"The apartment is beautiful, comfortable, and SO spacious! Easily large enough for 5 people. The fresh fruit, orange juice, and organic milk were a great touch, and the decor/photographs were so eclectic and fun.  Also loved their solution for an exposed brick wall without the mess (hint: it involves plexiglass). Little Village may seem a tad rough for those unfamiliar with city living, but I never felt unsafe for a moment -- we had an excellent time eating Mexican food and walking up and down Cermak. And yes, the apartment is near the train and the train makes noise -- but I thought it was kind of funny and it only lasts 10 seconds at a time. Totally worth it."
4505,"We stayed at Craig & Kathleen's place when we were in town for a concert at Wrigley field and we cannot say enough nice things about this space and the hosts! Right beside the train, it was super easy to get to Wrigleyville and downtown, with tons of amenities within walking distance. Craig was absolutely amazing - we have never felt so welcomed by an airbnb host! The space is clean, spacious and wonderfully decorated with Craig's pictures. He was always available to provide suggestions for us and even came and hung out with us for the Mayweather vs McGregor fight! Our check in and check out times were extremely flexible, which allowed us to work around our flights home. We felt right at home in a strange city and it was all because of this amazing host. Thank you!! We will be back!!"
4505,"Beautiful flat, very artsy, clean, and near Pilsen."
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were gracious hosts for the evening I was passing through Chicago. The neighborhood was great (within walking distance of the Pink Line, Douglas Park, and a grocery store) and they couldn't have made the experience and better than it was. Highly recommended to anyone passing through or looking to crash for a week!"
4505,"We had a great time visiting Chicago, the house was beautiful and in a very convenient location, close to the train and lots of restaurants and a brewery. Craig and Kathleen were fantastic hosts. Definitely recommend staying here."
4505,We enjoyed our stay very much. Craig and Kathleen are very good host. Thank you!
4505,"Had a blast, and they make you feel very welcome. Food was great and they made sure there was a variety for everyone's appetite. Met some great people on this trip."
4505,Craig and Kathleen opened their home to us and treated us like one of the family. We had a wonderful time and would recommend them to family and friends :)
4505,Craig & Kathleen made us feel incredibly welcome in their home. They were the kindest and most generous hosts and I can't rave enough about them. Truly Chicago's finest folks. Thanks for the great stay and I can't wait to come back next time we are in Chicago!
4505,"Craig and Kathleen went above and beyond to make my stay in their home as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Craig is the type of guy to give you the shirt off of his back if you needed it, and Kathleen was very helpful with making sure I got around town easily. I would definitely recommend staying with them!"
4505,A great place with an arty atmosphere.
4505,I kind of regret that I rented a car. The train station is literally right next to the house and you can use the train from the airport and to chicago downtown. Great location to use public transportation. It would be nicer if the floor was more clean.. I could see balls of dust under the TV stand and some spider webs and fruit flies in the kitchen. Interior was very neat and the aprtment has its own character. I enjoyed staying there and I would definitely stay there again!
4505,"I had a lovely stay here! The place is very homey, clean and comfortable. Located just outside the L's pink line, it's very convenient if you want to explore the city by train. Unless you're an extremely light sleeper, the train wont disturb you at night (in fact, I actually found it quite soothing). I only wish I could have stayed longer to take advantage of all this neat place had to offer!"
4505,"Craig & Kathleen's place was a great place for our family to stay for a weekend of adventures in the city. We drove in and parked with no problems and then took the train for everything. You are literally less than 20 yards from the pink line, it's great! We were traveling with our 3 and 1 year boys. The apartment had plenty of room for our family and the boys loved running back and forth on the hardwood floors. The home is older, so if old isn't your style, you probably won't like it. We love older homes and their charm. The space was clean and inviting. Craig's photographs are tastefully displayed and really add a lot as you get a sense of the  host's unique perspective. Personally, I  appreciated the extensive tea cabinet and the thoughtful touches like coffee, bagels + cream cheese,  fresh fruit, milk and OJ in the fridge! I hope we are able to come back again!"
4505,"Great base to explore Chicago. The apartment is beautiful and incredibly convenient, with a metro station right across the road"
4505,"Great location with quick access to the Pink line. The unit is an older building  in an older neighbourhood, but is very clean. 

Craig was great staying up late for check-in, providing fruit,  milk, juice, and bagels. The wifi is great as well. We really enjoyed our stay."
4505,"10/10 would recommend. My two friends and I stayed and had an absolute blast. The location was fantastic and it was a great space. After a long day out on the town, all you have to do is catch the Pink line train to the California stop, walk down the stairs, and youâ€™re back. This place made our girls trip even better, and saved our achy feet after spending the days walking around Chicago and the Museum campus! Craig and Kathleenâ€™s place was a dream-come-true."
4505,"Craig & Kathleenâ€™s place is a perfect place for family or groups traveling. There are 3 queen beds, 1 king bed and 1 restroom. They leave the whole floor for us to use, includes the kitchen. They offer teas & coffee & breads & fruits & bathing supplies & clean towels. The position is very convenient and safe as well. This is my first airbnb experience, same as my friends. We really enjoy the time that stay in the place. Besides above, I just want to mention that Craig is a very very very nice person. We like him very much. He is very friendly and generous. Just in case some people afraid of animals, Craig and Kathleen have a cat and a dog. But they are very quiet and barely show. We didn't see the cat, but only see the dog once since my friend ask for. So, it would not be a problem at all. You will never regret for choose Craig & Kathleenâ€™s place. :)"
4505,Craig & Kathleen have been great hosts. The location was safe which was important to my friends and I since we were on a girls trip. We were across the street from the pink line. They were kind and thoughtful to provide us with a small breakfast during our stay.
4505,"One of the best Airbnbs in Chicago, is a must stay whit them"
4505,"Awesome spot

Hope to go back soon"
4505,"We enjoyed our time at Craig and Kathleen's. The apartment definitely had an artistic charm, was clean, spacious, and was close to transportation. The hosts were very helpful in giving us pointers on how to utilize the public transportation, which is helpful since parking in Chicago can be shit. I would most definitely book with them again."
4505,"This place is the beeâ€™s knees.  Ample space for the six of us.  Only one bathroom but we adjusted accordingly.  Craig was a gracious host.  Mr. Sanchez as well.  We didnâ€™t meet Kathleen or the cat, but Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™re equally as rad.  A stoneâ€™s throw from the pink line.  And Lagunitas!"
4505,"Craig went above & beyond by giving us a parking space for the duration of our trip - parking in Chicago is very hard!  If you're in Chicago and need to have a car, this is a great option."
4505,"Great location right next to the Pink Line CTA station made travel into the city quick & easy. 
A great space for our family of 5.
Craig & Kathleen even had breakfast items available for us. Very thoughtful!"
4505,Very welcoming and responsive.  There when I had questions otherwise I didnâ€™t know they were there-very nice
4505,"Craig is my favorite host on Airbnb! If you get a chance to stay here, take it."
4505,"Very cute and spacious apt near public transport. Craig kindly provided breakfast and all communication was quick and easy. Very large 3 bedroom apt, almost too big for one person! "
4505,Some colleagues and I stayed at Craig & Kathleen's place for an education conference.  Being next to the pink line was so convenient.  It looks us to the loop and we could get anywhere we wanted to go.  Craig answered all of our questions and provided a map to help us. We walked 4 blocks to a grocery store at night and felt respected and safe.
4505,"Craig and Kathleen are amazing hosts, and we really enjoyed our stay. The proximity to the Pink Line stop could not have been more convenient. The space was comfortable and more than adequate for three adults and two kids. The outside space was lovely, and we all really enjoyed the company of Mr. Sanchez and Aaron. Take some time to look through Craig's photos that adorn the walls of the apartment: they're really amazing.

A quick note to white-bread middle-American travelers such as ourselves: the house is located in a working class neighborhood that has yet to be bitten by the gentrification bug. We never felt unsafe, but it was a little bit of culture shock for us."
4505,"This is a very large space with room for quite a few people.  Craig was very gracious to provide snacks for us and a warm welcome to boot.  The location is extremely close to the pink line, so getting in and out of the city is a breeze.  There is a lot of character in this space, and I recommend it!"
4505,"The apartment is really stylishly decorated and super convienently located next to the train. Craig and Kathleen really go the extra mile to make this rental as traveler-friendly as possible and we appreciated that a lot during our stay. Craig was around during our stay and was friendly and happy to chat, but he also left us to our own devices to enjoy the apartment and city."
4505,"Such great hosts and a great place to stay as well!! Loved it, would do it again in a second!"
4505,"We had a great time at Craig and Kathleenâ€™s!
All as per description with nice little attention too!
"
4505,"We didn't get to meet Kathleen, but Craig was a great host. He had nice suggestions for our vacation in Chicago. The apartment is large, open and spacious, and it is ideally located for getting around the city, with the Pink Line station just steps away. Free parking was a valuable bonus for us. We really enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"
4505,Craig is the American way of life. More than a host! My Buddy in Chicago! 
4505,"We had a great time at Craig and Kathleen's house! Craig met us when we arrived and was extremely friendly and helpful. Parking worked out really well, but would be tricky for a large vehicle like a van or truck. The place is huge with high ceilings and incredibly spacious. Craig and Kathleen were so generous to leave some fruit, milk, orange juice, and pastry for us. And the location cannot be beat! A 1 minute (or less) walk to the train that got us downtown in 20 minutes. We would definitely be back!"
4505,"Decent place,  close by to Train Station,"
4505,Craig and Kathleen are FANTASTIC
4505,"Craig and Kathleen run a fun, affordable, and well put together place to stay. No problems with check-in (I had to park about a 7 minute walk away but thatâ€™s to be expected in Chicago). Their animals are adorable and friendly. I really have no complaints whatsoever!"
4505,This is a great place to stay and Craig is a terrific host!  We were able to have the whole family stay in one place. There were six of us and enough hot water for everyone to shower! Amazing! The beds are comfortable and there were plenty of soaps and shampoos to choose from. The house is on the Pink Line and makes it easy to get into Downtown Chicago. I would definitely recommend Craig's place for family's that need a nice place to stay with plenty of beds!
4505,"We really had a great time. Being so close to the train was such a huge benefit. Being our first time to Chicago, the extra tips from Craig about the area were invaluable. We also got great use from all the Chicago info around the apartment. Oh, and Mr. Sanchez was icing on the cake! We would definitely go back and stay there again without hesitation!"
4505,"I would recommend Craig as a host. He was very helpful and waited for us until late for check in. He kindly bought bagels, cream cheese, milk and fruits for us to have upon arrival. He also accepted to receive packages for us and gave good tips about a local breweries and supermarkets. The apartment is located right next to the pink metro line, very convinient and easy to get to the city center. The place is very spacious, maybe a bit too spacious for just 3 people."
4505,"Craig and Kathleen were wonderful hosts! All the amenities you never knew you needed and more were provided. Craig was super accommodating with our late arrival flight time and was still very welcoming. Since the occassion we were in Chicago for was my birthday, Craig had a small cake with a candle and a card for me. I want to go back to Chicago just to stay there. Thanks again Craig and Kathleen!"
4505,"I'd recommend Craig and Kathleen's place to anyone looking for a cozy, clean, conveniently located AirBnB in Chicago. It's located literally across the road from a Pink Line train station, which takes you straight to downtown - where most of the tourist-y places to see are. You can transfer to any of the lines from various Pink Line stations too, so the entirety of Chicago's public transport system is at your fingertips. There's a great supermarket less than half a mile away too. The apartment itself is very large (fit 4 of us very comfortably, I think it'd fit up to 6 or so without too many issues. There is only one bathroom, though) and cozy. The place was very clean. The hosts are very hospitable and accommodating, and even bought some fruits and bagels and juice for us before we checked in."
7126,"We really enjoyed our stay at Sarah's place!  Great community..walking distance from tons of bars and shopping.  Studio was ""just right"" for our week away in Chicago. Thanks Sarah!"
7126,The apartment was comfortable and convenient.  I enjoyed the restaurants and bakery that were close.
7126,We had a great stay at Sarah's studio. Very convienent to cool neighborhoods and downtown. Private entrance makes it easy to come and go on your own schedule.
7126,"Positives:  Good price, nice street, one block from a fun, hip commercial area with lots of independent stores, restaurants, bars.  Negatives: Apt. is dark without much natural light, poor cell phone reception (verizon is my carrier), no internet unless you have Comcast, 1/2 mile to nearest el stop. Also, it's good to know that you need to turn on hot shower water about 5 minutes before it warms up - once it does it's fine.  "
7126,"Wonderful place, wonderful location. I stayed for three nights but would happily have stayed for longer. Hopefully I'll get the chance to stay again in the future.

Don't be put off by the description of ""tiny"" - I'm 6.4 and not exactly svelte and didn't feel hemmed in at all. 

Highly recommended."
7126,"My partner and I stayed at Sarah's place between October 16, and Octob (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) We had a great time. 

The apartment is by no means tiny, despite its description. It is as big as, if not bigger, than any hotel room in the city. You can tell that Sarah is very thoughtful as far as her guests are concerned. Prior to arriving, she had emailed us giving us the combination to the lockbox and offering to give us directions and even obtain a parking permit for us. When we got to the place, our bed was made, there was an assortment of fresh towels and she even had tourist magazines/pamphlets  about Chicago. The apartment has a seperate enterance at the side of the building, which made coming back to the place late at night easy without a worry of waking anyone up. We also really enjoyed the internet access.

The location of the apartment was great too. There were lots of great bars and restaurants on Division St., just a few steps away from the place. It was close to the Subway and is a short subway ride from Downtown Chicago(two or three stops to Clark/Lake). 

All-in-all we had a great trip and Sarah's place played a large role in that. When we return to Chicago, I would certainly stay at Sarah's place again.

Stanley"
7126,"Sarah's place is adorable! The separate entrance is great so you can come in at all hours of the night.
The neighborhood is beautiful and safe too, a lot of bars/pubs, restaurants and other things you'd need.
The apartment is about 15 minutes walk to the blue line station which isn't bad at all, considering how sparse the L stations are."
7126,"We stayed at sarah's for 5 days in early December. The weather was cold, but the apartment kept us toasty warm. You're just around the corner from tons of bars/resturants and public transport. The neighborhood has definately changed since I lived there years ago, but there are still some dirty dive bars left between the doggy day spas and yoga studios. The place is just the right size for a couple. It is a garden flat, so doesn't get a ton of natural light especially in winter. Overall a great private spot  in a good area for exploring the city. "
7126,"I haven't the time to give a review proportionate to the care, thought, and style that Sarah put into making this small apartment (in NY it'd be considered a one bedroom) a delightful short-term home. "
7126,"Just back from our stay 5/29- 5/3l.  The apartment is
PERFECT for a single or couple.  A great location if
you want to stay a little outside of downtown.  It's
a GREAT neighborhood with MUCH to offer.  And if it's
downtown you want, it's very accessible with public
transportation.  If you have your own car, Sarah provides parking passes where you can find parking
right in front of the apartment.  If you're unfamiliar 
with chicago, no worries - she provides tons of books,
maps, liturature on the shelves for your own browsing or
she is very approachable for verbal direction and ideas.
Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU STAY HERE WHILE IN CHICAGO.
Thank you Sarah. (loved the ""budding"" artists and their sidewalk work that greeted us each day"" Karen and Kevin Cleveland, Ohio
"
7126,"This was my first airbnb stay and it was a great experience! I was in Chicago for a class and chose to try airbnb instead of staying at a hotel, I'm so glad I did. I never would have discovered this neighborhood otherwise, and I felt like a local for a week. The studio is in an excellent location, a wonderful neighborhood to explore and a short and very convenient commute on the train into downtown. It is very private and Sarah responded immediately to any questions or needs I had. There is literature about Chicago, music, tea, quilts, a binder of recommended restaurants -it is a cozy traveling home. Highly recommended!"
7126,"Wonderful, it looks just like the photos, only cozier."
7126,"was very worth the stay. having lived in chicago, this is one of the neighborhoods we missed so it felt great to stay at the apartment and truly be there."
7126,"Sarah and Scott were great hosts. We were comfortable and had everything we needed for a great stay. They communicate well and are totally unobtrusive. The neighborhood is quite lively, very nice, and not far from downtown Chicago. The L is about a 15 minute walk away, however, don't be afraid to use the bus. It will save you at least 15 minutes getting into the city if you time it right (use (Hidden by Airbnb) maps.) The only thing that was less than perfect was the cell phone reception in the apartment. We had to leave our phones by the window to make sure we got enough reception for our phones to ring and had to step outside to actually talk on the phone. Still, this was no big deal. The next time I go to Chicago, I will definitely look for this place again. "
7126,Our stay here was nice. The place is exactly  as described and in a very nice neighborhood. Plenty of places to see and eat nearby and not far from the blue line. Getting into the place was super easy and Sarah had clean towels and soap ready. For the value you will have a hard time finding a better place. 
7126,"A cool flat in a great neighbourhood, very international and a lot of things to do! ItÂ´s really like you can see on the pictures. We have enjoyed our stay in Chicago!
Thanks a lot  "
7126,"Beautiful small place with everything you need, silent road full of trees, and a young and vibrant neiborhood. Highly recommendable, and Sara is very cool."
7126,Nice apartment and beautiful neighbourhood. We enjoyed our stay!
7126,Great little apartment. Met all our needs. Sarah was great taking the iniative to research places of particular interest to us. Good fast wifi. Happy to stay there again. Good location. 
7126,"The studio was large. It had everything in there. Stove, fridge, microwave. Feels like a home. Bathroom was nice with lots of towels. Just took awhile for the water to get hot. Bedroom has AC. The bed sort of was lower in the middle than the ends.

Location was great. I walked from the Blue line train to her place. For me it was not far. A bus stop within a five minute walk there will take you straight to Michigan Ave. I noticed many small restaurants nearby. 

Sarah communicated well by email. I didn't get a chance to meet her however. 

Great value and would be a nice spot for couples or single travelers. "
7126,"The apartment was great and the neighborhood is awesome. The walk to the el was definitely manageable; we never took a cab or bus.

My one complaint is that a real mattress would be more comfy than the futon they have in there."
7126,"It's been my first experience with airbnb and I can only say it's been GREAT!
Sarah's place is a one bedroom apartment with everything you need so don't worry about towels or a hairdryer!It is quiet and makes you feel at home even being so far away from ours (we live in Spain)I loved the bathroom and the cozy (Website hidden by Airbnb) slept very comfortably.
We became fans of the neighborhood, the street and the city thanks to its location.
We stayed 2 times (three nights each time) and we would never change the experience for anything!!!
We highly recommend it!!

Thanks for all!!!!
"
7126,ItÂ´s the second time we stayed at SarahÂ´s and everything was perfect.We loved the area!!!
7126,"My sister and I stayed in Sarahâ€™s studio this past weekend (Oct. 16-18, 2010) and as our first airbnb experience I must say it was a very positive one. We contacted Sarah at a very late notice (1 day prior) and she was able to accommodate us. Sarahâ€™s studio is large and very cozy. Checking in is easy and hassle-free as she leaves the keys to the place in a lock box and gives you the combination prior to your arrival. She will even obtain a parking permit for you if you have a car so that you may park in front of the place and avoid getting ticketed. The entire apartment is private and for your use only throughout your stay. Sarah is not intrusive, and you probably wonâ€™t see her throughout the entire stay. We just so happened to bump into her outside on the second day of our stay and she gave us a friendly hello. She seems to be very gracious and sweet. The apartment has everything you need-a fridge, a microwave, kitchen utensils, an iron, fresh towels, soap to shower, and more. I was pleasantly surprised to find an interesting collection of books and music. Sarah leaves a detailed letter with everything there is to know-the dos and donâ€™ts, and places to eat, shop, & be entertained. The cable television works just fine and the bathroom was my favorite as it was very clean and there was warm water for showering. The bed was comfortable-perfect for one to two people. The blankets were my sisterâ€™s favorite as they kept us VERY warm in the chilly Chicago weather. The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet and as two young females traveling alone in a big city, we felt very safe here. 

Overall, it was the perfect place to stay for us-itâ€™s cheaper than a hotel and far bigger and cozier in my opinion, and we felt right at home. It gave us a chance to really get a feel for the city and feel like locals, which is an experience you donâ€™t get at a hotel. We fell in love with this place-we would definitely stay again and highly recommend it!
"
7126,"Cozy, comfortable!  Love this area.  Great place to stay to get a good sense of the Village and Wicker Park.  Sarah also offered us parking permits, which was super nice!  Great host.  Unfortunately, the shower didn't really drain- for a long time....basic maintenance I suppose.  Otherwise, would stay here again."
7126,"This place is super cozy and definitely a steal. Bigger than i was expecting. In a very cute and safe neighborhood, near a lot of good food. Go to Sultan's Market!"
7126,"Really clean and thoughtfully set up little place. Sarah has left plenty of local information and reading material on Chicago to get you pumped up about seeing the city. Sarah's very friendly and helpful, and getting into the place, even with our late arrival time, was super easy. She left parking permits for our three night stay which was very handy. The local area (Ukrainian Village) is full of delicious restaurants and bars, and not too far to walk to public transport, or even downtown if you're up for it. We had a great time here and highly recommend it to others. "
7126,"Great neighborhood to be in, especially nice to have street parking right there. Easy access to tons of restaurants, cafes, bars... Nice little private and quiet 1 bedroom apartment, only drawback was that the futon was super dense and could use a foam mattress pad as I'm used to a softer bed. Definitely a far better value for the $$ than any inexpensive hotels that you would find in the city. "
7126,"Sarah and Scott's apt. is a great place to stay in Chicago.  The neighborhood is great, easily accessible from downtown and/or the airport by subway (and bike!).  I had a very smooth time getting in and out and was very comfortable in the space.  I found the futon very comfortable (after the 20 or so hour ride on Amtrak, it was good for my back!)and I enjoyed having the privacy to come and go without disturbing the family.  As other reviewers have said, I hardly ran into them, although I did have the pleasure of meeting Scott and their lovely children in the backyard one morning (that backyard is really nice, by the way...). When I needed a minor repair on the shower curtain rod, Scott kindly took care of it right away.  I especially appreciated having the use of a bicycle while I was there which they threw in as part of the deal.  Chicago is a great city to explore by bike and I was lucky enough to enjoy (mostly) unseasonably warm weather.  I highly recommend both the facilities and the hosts!"
7126,"Sarah and Scott's place was my first introduction to Airbnb and Chicago and I enjoyed my stay there very much.  The mini-flat is clean and neat and I never saw my hosts so it felt very private.  It's in a nice part of town and about 10min walk to the train.  I also chose to walk into downtown Chicago on a nice sunny day, an easy half-hour'ish walk.  There's a number of bars and restaurants around the corner from their house, and also quite a few to choose from outside the train station.  I loved Chicago city itself and would stay at Sarah's again.   "
7126,"We were there such a short time, we missed Sarah entirely - but it was an A-mazing place to stay. Harvey was super welcoming and we were 100% comfortable."
7126,"Adorable, immaculately clean private apartment in great location with easy access to downtown. We never actually interacted with the host but she was very communicative and we knew she was available if needed. We particularly enjoyed the music collection, books and Chicago travel guides that were provided. Will definitely stay here again when in Chicago."
7126,"This quaint studio is in a great location. It's close to restaurants, bars, shopping and grocery stores as well as public transportation. I felt as if Sarah was more than adequately prepared for her guests: there were binders with information about local establishments, coupons, tips, and other recommendations. There was even a parking pass provided.

The studio is small, clean, neat, and just right for 1 or 2 guests. The decor is a mixture of vintage and eccentric. There are many photos, cds, and books provided. Should you need it there is a tv with cable and dvd player. The bedroom included A/C and a heater, so you'll feel comfortable no matter the season.

Even though the apartment is the lower level of their home, I never heard or was disrupted by the family or neighbors. It really felt like i was in my own home. Anytime I needed anything Sarah was prompt in answering emails or phone calls.

Overall, my stay at Sarah's apartment was very pleasant and the next time I'm in Chicago I'll be sure to book it again."
7126,"Sarah was very nice and friendly. The place was alright for a night, but I wouldn't stay here longer. It was in an interesting, fun neighborhood, with cafes and restaurants within walking distance. Unfortunately, when we arrived there was a problem with the natural gas. The whole apartment smelled like natural gas. Sarah was however very helpful and had someone come out and check it immediately. Overall, we had a decent stay, but wouldn't stay here again. "
7126,"Sarah and Scott's place was my first introduction to Airbnb and Chicago and I really enjoyed my stay there very much. The space is clean and neat and I never saw my hosts so it felt very private. 

It's in a nice part of town also around the corner you will find a lot of pub and bars around the place, there a pace call it the smooke daddy that i really enjoy.

Sarah was very profesional with us."
7126,Great location in an awesome neighborhood convenient to public transportation. We had a wonderful time.
7126,Checking in and out was a breeze. The place was clean and comfortable. Would definitely visit again. :) 
7126,"The place is very cozy and charming and it works well in terms of public transportation and having access to the city. Overall it is very nice place. I would be only concerned with the circulation of air, if one does not want to turn the air conditioning on. "
7126,"we loved it! the location is great and sarah is very nice! we""ll be back!"
7126,"Sarah's apartment was clean and orderly when we arrived, and she'd set out a Welcome notebook with tons of information on local restaurants, grocery stores, bars, and myriad other services, complete with little capsule reviews and directions.  She was easy to get in touch with when needed, but we also had complete privacy.  To boot, the neighborhood where the place is located (Wicker Park) is extremely cute.  We had a great time!"
7126,"S. is very responsive. Made checking in/out very easy, and we enjoyed our stay. Great neighborhood, close to public transit, and lots of delicious restaurants around the area. "
7126,"What a wonderful place to stay! Much better than a hotel, plus Sarah was super-flexible about our check-out time the last day. My fiancee and I were only staying 3 nights, so we didn't worry too much about cooking, but it was great to have a way to heat up our leftovers and whatnot.

We didn't see much of Sarah, Scott, or their children, but when we did, they were fantastically nice people. 

The only problem with this place is the utter lack of cell phone reception, but that's hardly the hostess's fault. "
7126,"Valore positivament l'apartament de Sarah, que estÃ  net i ben equipat. Per a una parella Ã©s perfecte, ja que tÃ© un dormitori, un menjador gran amb cuina (amb una cuina immensa, on podries cuinar perfectament el titot per al Thanksgiving) i un bany. Els propietaris, que viuen al costat, sÃ³n la discreciÃ³ personificada i nomÃ©s els vaig veure de casualitat.
Un altre avantatge de l'apartament Ã©s la seua biblioteca, molt completa pel que fa a informaciÃ³ sobre Chicago, amb diverses monografies, llibres de fotografies, revistes d'histÃ²ria de la ciutat i nombroses guies de viatge d'Ã¨poques diverses (des dels anys seixanta a l'actualitat) que proporcionen moltÃ­ssima informaciÃ³ complementÃ ria al viatger per descobrir els llocs mÃ©s insÃ²lits de la ciutat. Felicite especialment Sarah per aquest detall.
L'apartament t'interessarÃ  nomÃ©s si prefereixes no instalÂ·lar-te al downtown, ja que per arribar al centre haurÃ s d'agafar primer l'autobÃºs 70 (que ressegueix West Division Street) fins a la parada del metro blau de Division. El trajecte et costarÃ  en total entre mitja hora i quaranta minuts.
Tot i aixÃ², el barri ofereix prou alÂ·licients per a poder dur una vida cÃ²moda. EstÃ  situat en un carrer molt tranquil i agradable d'Ukrainian Village, a la part mÃ©s propera a Wicker Park.
A la zona mÃ©s prÃ²xima a l'apartament, a West Division, trobarÃ s la Letizia's Natural Backery per a desdejunar o el restaurant argentÃ­ Folklore (cantonada amb Hoyne Ave) per a un bon sopar a base de â€œparrilladaâ€. Hi ha diversos abrevaderos com el 50/Fifty, perÃ² sÃ³n molt sorollosos.
MÃ©s interessant Ã©s la zona de Wicker Park, amb la magnÃ­fica i original cockteleria Violet Hour (just al costat de la parada de metro de Wicker, a N Damen Ave: compte, perquÃ¨ l'entrada es fa a travÃ©s d'una paret cega, empaperada amb anuncis; no hi ha nom ni res, com si estiguÃ©rem en els temps de la ProhibiciÃ³).
Un altre bon abrevadero proper Ã©s el Gunner's -mÃ©s tradicional-, a N Milwaukee Ave i, per a menjar, tens un xinÃ¨s de qualitat tambÃ© a Milwaukee (el Papajin) i la magnÃ­fica bar-be-que Llillies'Q a W North Ave.
Molt prop de l'apartament perÃ² a Western Ave amb Cortez St estÃ  l'Empty Bottle, una de les principals sales de la ciutat on veure grups indies.
Just al costat de l'Empty Bottle tens tambÃ© una coin-laundry oberta les vint-i-quatre hores del dia (i amb les secadores gratuÃ¯tes). Per a comprar menjar haurÃ s d'anar lluny, al Jewel que hi ha al costat de la parada de metro Clark/Division, perÃ² tens l'avantatge que l'autobÃºs 70 et deixa just al davant. "
7126,"Really cosy apartment in a great neighborhood. Its not fancy but Sarah doesn't over-sell it - you get what you're expecting.  Very simple, clean, quiet. Really awesome location for Wicker Park/Ukranian Village and v close to subway/  We loved it.
"
7126,"Our stay in this apartment was great! It's in a very good location on a quiet leafy street, minutes to lots of cafes pubs and restaurants. Sarah was very communicative and helpful with directions finding the place. We had an issue with the stove on our last night which meant no hot water the next morning, but Sarah was very quick to resolve it and assist us. The apartment is as described, very small but it is well equipped and clean. As the family does live above you will notice some noise up above but generally it is quiet. Easy to get to from airport, 10min walk to the station and another 10 to downtown Chicago or 25 to airport in the opposite direction. Overall a good stay, great friendly and safe neighborhood, would stay again!"
7126,"Positives: super clean and uncluttered. cute neighborhood w/ gorgeous brownstones. affordable price. much welcome amenities such as hangers, extra towels, kitchen, bedroom is actually a separate tiny room. Sarah kept in contact via email and made herself available, but still afforded us total privacy.

Negatives: bed was fine, but could've been more comfortable. poor AT&T reception (fine if you step right outside, though). pretty poor WiFi reception, internet referenced to be in a certain spot, but we couldn't locate it. lack of connection to internet/phone encourages you to go outside, though, which is what you should do when traveling anyway."
7126,"We have mixed feelings about staying at Sarah's place.

Positives are the following: free parking space, localization near to the city center, no sharing the appartment with any one else and a very good contact with Sarah.

Negatives are as follows: the apartment was not clean! we moved a chair a little bit and there was dirt all over the flor also we have seen several spiders and a quite a big bug running around the flor plus we there was previous guests food in the fridge: pieces of pizza, some milk, etc; we also got the access to internet on the second  day of our stay...

Compare positive and negative stuff yourself:)   "
7126,"Great place to stay.  We very much enjoyed our week in the apartment. Area is ideal.  Close to everything.  Lots of funky shops and cafes close by.  thanks,  will stay again next time in Chitown!!!"
7126,"I had a great time at this little place. It is really close to delicious food and fun bars and their street is really pretty.  My friend and I were in town to run the Chicago Marathon, and we wanted a nice place to relax afterwards--this was my first airbnb experience--and I really liked it!"
7126,"Tiny place, but very clean and in a cute part of Wicker Park.  We could easily walk down to Division St and enjoy cool restaurants and bars-so nice to not worry about your car.  The futon may not be for everyone, but we slept fine.  Sarah responded to all my emails immediately and everything went really smoothly.  Perfect place for a couple looking to enjoy Chicago on a budget!"
7126,"Nice space, clean, good work-table,  comfortable bed, excellent in apt.  library; great neighborhood;  Sarah was deadly competent in arranging access and parking;   all systems go! "
7126,"My parents stayed at the Tiny Studio Apartment for two nights while visiting for Thanksgiving. (I walked them over to the apartment when they arrived, it is a very ideal space.) The best characteristics of this apartment are the neighborhood and the price - easily half of what you will pay at the cheapest hotel in Chicago. They felt very comfortable staying here as it is a cozy apartment in a safe neighborhood. 

In the future, if I have an overflow of family or friends visiting, I will definitely suggest they rent the Tiny Studio Apartment instead of an overpriced hotel downtown that lacks the shopping, bars and restaurants in Ukrainian Village (but I'm bias since I live in and love the area)."
7126,"This apartment was perfect for me as I dealt with the aftermath of a small apartment fire: affordable, clean, and very well located. Not fancy, but well put together. I wish I would have had more time to enjoy the nice selection of literature on the shelf."
7126,"The Tiny Studio Apartment was a great place to stay. It had everything we needed for a comfortable stay, only a short walk to the subway and plenty of local options for food + shopping. 

Overall a great place to stay.  "
7126,"Sarah's apartment is a lovely place to stay in Chicago. Great neighbourhood, clean, cosy and comfortable. "
7126,"We had a wonderful stay in Chicago and Sarah's studio was definitely part of that. In a beautiful surburb, that was very close to downtown. The buses were regular and the neighborhood so friendly. We didn't actually meet Sarah as the studio has its own entrance and we were free to come and go whenever it suited. We recommend to other most definitely. "
7126,"Great location and space.  Very close walk to lots of restaurants and shops, wi-fi, on street parking, and a nice little apartment.  There were lots of interesting books on the shelves as well!"
7126,"Petit appartement dans un trÃ¨s bon quartier. 
"
7126,"I am just back from Chicago and my stay at the Tiny Studio. Sarah was a helpful host- good with communication and friendly. The apartment was as advertised- tiny but clean, comfortable and quiet. I really enjoyed the neighborhood. As a solo traveller I had no problem finding places to eat by myself.  I would definitely stay here again.  Thanks, Sarah!"
7126,"Nice little home away from home. Great location once you figure out the public transport, and right by a bunch of cafes, bars, and a short walk to pharmacy & supermarket. The place was super private but with the benefit of knowing Sarah is right upstairs if you need anything. A large folder full of information on the neighborhood, aircon & heat if you need it, clean bathroom, comfy bed and chest of drawers and wardrobe to store your stuff. CDs and books to read, TV - AND the street is beautiful so you feel super safe. thanks Sarah!"
7126,"Sarah apt was perfect for us.  We love the Wicker Park area, and enjoyed being about to walk to our favorite hangouts yet still have a quite and peaceful place to sleep.  Would highly recommend to anyone!  :)"
7126,"Great studio apartment, everything you could need for a short stay.  Parking was easy and the location very convenient.  "
7126,"Sarah was a great host and she responded pretty quickly to all of our inquires. The apartment is close by to a bunch of great places to eat. And we appreciated how the apartment was totally separate from the rest of the apartment, so we had our own (Website hidden by Airbnb) has it's own side door into the apt.  
The ""L"" train/subway and buses are within walking distance, so it makes it easy to get around without having to rent a car.
For the light sleepers, the neighborhood is very quiet , so no need to worry about that.
"
7126,Sarah was a wonderful host. The apartment is in a fine location and perfect as a base to explore the area as well as the city itself. It is exactly as advertised - a perfect no frills place to lay your head at night. Thanks Sarah! We'll be back.
7126,"Location is great--blue line at Damen or Division is an easy walk, tons of restaurants and bars nearby, it's on a treelined street that's beautiful and safe, and Sarah's description of the apartment is accurate.  The bathroom was clean with plenty of linens.  The bed is a futon, so after the third night we were ready for our bed at home.  The apartment is dark; the kitchen is not conducive to cooking and was not particularly clean.  Though we never saw her, Sarah communicated with us promptly and the key retrieval was smooth.  This is a great basic apartment in a convenient location if what you're looking for is a place to sleep and shower."
7126,"Excellent value, excellent location.  Safe neighborhood, near public transportation, lots of restaurant options very close. Simple, clean and comfortable. Perfect for someone traveling alone."
7126,"We had a great time at Sarah's. The place might be quite small but space was never an issue and the bed is a great size and comfy too. The apartment is situated in a perfect location if you're after cute boutiques, restaurants and bars, some of which stay open until very late in the morning.
We didn't see Sarah but certainly felt her presence - the neighbourhood shortly lost power on two occasions during our stay due to the weather and Sarah made an effort to let us know before we had even got home and supplied us with a torch and candles - very helpful."
7126,"Had a great stay! It was a wonderful location and while very private, Sarah was readily accessible when needed. "
7126,"Me and Adam loved the apartment. Perfect location, within walking distance to Wicker Park and blue line. Extremely safe and really great neighborhood. We will look Sarah up again! "
7126,"Great flat in a great location. Close to public transport. Sarah is an awesome host, friendly and accommodating. Definitely recommend."
7126,Cozy apartment in a great location!   Thank you so much!
7126,Small and cozy apt. in a great location!
7126,"We really enjoyed our stay in Chicago. The apartment was fully equipped with everything we needed and Sarah was a very helpful and friendly host. The location is also excellent - very close to restaurants, bars and public transport.  "
7126,"We had a great stay.  The location is fantastic.  The apartment is very comfortable.  Combined with the price, we had a great experience.  Will definitely stay here again.  Thanks so much Sarah!"
7126,"Good location, walking distance to shops/restaurants/bars in Ukrainian Village and Wicker Park. Also very close to the blue line which takes you straight to O'hare. "
7126,"Great location, especially for the price. Near lots of shops and restaurants, as well as the blue line to get downtown or to O'hare. Sarah was a very accommodating and helpful host. "
7126,"Perfect location, exactly how Sarah described her place! "
7126,"My fiancee and I traveled to Chicago for a family wedding, and we wanted a place that was affordable, close to transportation, and that was in a fun neighborhood.  Sarah's place was absolutely perfect.  While we had a wonderful time with family, we also had a great time exploring the neighborhood by foot.  As my uncle said, ""You did what tourists should do, but never do.""  We didn't make it to any museums this trip, but we did eat at Milk and Honey, had a great time stumbling into the Flipside Cafe (best Italian soda of my life) and had lots of fun walking around Milwaukee Avenue.  Sarah was very communicative, and even recommended a local event in the middle of our stay that we never would have known about.  We hope to stay there another time - thank you!"
7126,"As Sarah described it's a tiny studio, well equipped and 
really well located. 
Transportation just around the corner (bus 70) that get's you to the subway (or you can walk in 10min). The subway will get you fast to the loop.
The neighborhood was really nice, calm, just one block away from a main street, where you can find lot's of places for breakfast or more elaborated meals...
Sara had documentation on place about the city and the restaurants around and she was around to give us any help if needed. Recommended!"
7126,"Sarah's spot was perfect for my boyfrined & I. It's situated in a nice neighborhood with great food, bars, and cute boutiques within a few blocks walking distance. We didn't need to rent a car since we were so close to the blue line & could easily get to and from the airport, downtown, and anywhere else we needed to go. Sarah was very accomodating and I would definitely stay here again."
7126,"I spent three days at Sarah's place with my husband and we didn't like it. The apartment had un uncared-for look, I think no one had cleaned it for a long time! The (very) small space was kind of a messy, papers spread all over the place and loads of dust and cobweb in the corners and under the bed. The mattress was terrible and my husband couldn't rest throughout our stay. However, the location is really very good since it's fairly close to the metro station and Division Street is a really nice spot."
7126,"Great little apartment. There were plates, frying pans, and everything we needed to prepare some of our own meals. There are many Chicago related  books and pictures that were great to browse through. TV and a CD player with a stack of CD's to listen to. We ended each day walking around the Ukraine Neighborhood. Nice quiet street. Sarah is an awesome host! "
7126,"We loved Sarah's place. It was absolutely perfect for our needs.  In fact, I'd expected it to be much smaller but we had plenty of room for our purposes, especially after coming off two nights on a train and five nights in an LA hotel.  We found the location to be convenient, the neighborhood to be eclectic and interesting, and the distance to all that Chicago has to offer to be minimal.  My New Yorker husband had never been to Chicago and loved the city and Sarah's apartment. We're both hoping to come back and stay there soon.  We recommend this apartment to anyone who is looking for convenience, no-fuss and proximity to all that Chicago has to offer."
7126,"great place, great location, great privacy, great price!"
7126,We had a wonderful time. This place was what Sarah had described. It definately met expectations! Wonderful location. We walked everywhere and loved it! We have no major complaints. Overall great experience. You get what you pay for. Would definately return. B-)
7126,Great location and Sarah was more than accommodating for our stay. 
7126,"While definitely on the smaller side of things, Saran's apartment is both adorable and extremely convenient. It's only a short walk away from the blue line station, and a direct bus to downtown.. One thing to note is that while wireless Internet is provided, the signal is quite erratic. This wasn't a huge problem for us, but did make planning challenging at times. 

Overall an excellent apartment and great value for money, would definitely return! "
7126,"What can we add to 80-some positive references?  Nice place, nice street, nice neighborhood, responsive host.  The place isn't really all that small - how much space does a visitor need?"
7126,"Sarah's place is as described. Very homely, everything you need and about a 10 min walk to the subway. Sarah was happy to provide with some extra pots and pans of her own when we were cooking. Great place and top host."
7126,"This was a fun little place, exactly as described.  I don't have a lot else to say -- good times in Chicago. "
7126,"Sarah's little Tiny Studio was amazing. It felt like a little piece of home! It was in a great, safe neighborhood near what the locals deemed the ""Brooklyn of Chicago."" If you like culture, there is no better locale than that of the Tiny Studio. We plan to stay at the Tiny Studio when ever we have the opportunity!"
7126,"Great little spot in a fun neighborhood. This place met every one of our needs, and Sarah was a wonderful and attentive host. Will definitely be coming back to this studio next time we come to Chicago!"
7126,"This apartment was a warm, lovely little spot for me while I was in Chicago during a chilly week in March.  Great location. Great price. "
7126,The Tiny Studio Apartment was just what we needed. We got to see a lot of Chicago. It is a great spot to take public transportation from. Sarah was very helpful and pointed us in that direction. You do not want to pay for parking downtown. Had a great experience here.
7126,"The Tiny Studio is located in a beautiful neighbourhood. Lots of great restaurants and interesting shops, and it's very quick walk to the train. The apartment itself is cozy, and equipped with everything needed to prepare quick meals. Sarah was very friendly and helpful. Overall, we had a great experience. "
7126,"This was really the ideal spot. Most things that I came to Chicago for were easily accessible from this cute little apartment. Unlike the locals, the weather wasn't overly friendly; so it was extra convenient to go on mini-outings and then retreat to the warmth of this conveniently located, clean cozy pad. I would totally stay here again when I visit Chicago during the summer months. Then it will be hot and I can really cover some ground. I should also mention that hostess was beyond accommodating!"
7126,"Sarah's place is cozy and warm. Its a 10 minute walk to the local train station and from there a 10 minute ride to downtown. The neighbourhood is really nice, some amazing brunch places to go to and plenty of vintage stores to dig through! 
The best part, however was how understanding Sarah was. Our flight was delayed and it was raining, we didnt want to spend 6 hours in the airport, so we wanted to stay a few extra hours, she agreed since it wasn't booked for the next day. Usually, in our past experience, people are not very accomodating and it was rally nice that she was. 
This place is ideal for a single person or a couple who are okay with not too much luxury, its a simple, cozy place. We didnt spend much time in doors, so not sure how well the kitchen works etc. But the it was super convinient for us and we had a great say overall. "
7126,"Great place. Convenient, clean and ideal for a long weekend in Chicago. Sarah was very responsive and accommodating. Highly recommend! "
7126,"Can't beat the price, and the neighborhood is so charming."
7126,"Location wise it's not bad about a 10 minute walk from the train, nice suburb, good local restaurants.

There is plenty of space in the room and the internet worked ok.

The bed was really uncomfortable though, they need a new one, it was like sleeping on a board with a pole in the middle."
7126,"This apartment was in a really great location (close to excellent restaurant, bars, and coffee shops, and also a close walk to 2 blue line stations). Sarah was a wonderful host. Very clean apt. Small as advertised, but everything you need for a brief stay in Chicago."
7126,"Sarah's apartment was a perfect base from which to discover Chicago. We really liked the location in a quiet, pretty neighborhood but close to many restaurants and bars. We never met Sarah, but communication with her went absolutely smoothly. All in all, we think this place is a great deal - and would definitely stay there again."
7126,"A very pleasant stay. The apartment was comfortable and had all the necessities and a lot of useful guidebooks and brochures on Chicago. Sarah was friendly and helpful. We loved the Ukrainian Village neighborhood with its tree-lined streets and beautiful old homes. The L station was within reasonable walking distance and the area had a young, active population and handy eating places. "
7126,"For our first and short trip to Chicago it was the perfect choice. We loved the appartment, that is ideal located in between the airport and close to city center. The awsome neighborhood provides varied street cafes. We would recommend the appartment to anybody and would like to use it anytime again.
Thanks for your hospitality, Sarah!

7126," My wife and I stayed at Sarah's apartment for three nights. The apartment is at a great location! Pretty close to bus 50 and blue line train Damen stop. The facility is well equipped with wifi, cable tv and other cookwares, so you can cook yourselves. Sarah is a nice host, she told us some details about the transportation and has a very cute greeting notes in her apartment to describe the surroundings as well as the instruction about the apartment. We really enjoyed our stay."
7126,This was my second time staying here and I had another excellent experience. I would highly recommend the Tiny Studio Apartment to anyone looking for affordable lodging in Chicago. It's super convenient to public transportation and located in a great neighborhood.
7126,"Great location and everything went well.  Unit is great for one or two people.  Everything was clean and ready when I arrived.  Overall a good stay.  

"
7126,We had a very nice 3 night stay at Sarah's apartment. It was stocked with everything we needed and the location could not be better! We will be back for sure!
7126,"Sarah was immediate with her confirmation and communications. The apartment is absolutely wonderful and perfectly suited for one person or a couple. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. A great apartment in a beautiful neighborhood! Thanks for everything, Sarah."
7126,"Great little apartment in a really great neighborhood. Sarah was really nice and left us candles and flashlights when a storm knocked out the power. The space isn't huge but was more than big enough for two people who aren't planning on spending a lot of time inside.

The neighborhood the apartment is in is quiet but just a block from a nice bustling street (Division) with tons of shops, restaurants and bars. The Damen stop for the El is only about a 15 minute walk away, making exploring Chicago super easy and convenient.

I would definitely stay here again!"
7126,"Sarah was very prompt and immediate with communication, and she was very helpful in providing directions/suggestions for what to do as well as accommodating our travel schedules, which we greatly appreciated. The apartment was small and just right for two people, and if you are unused to it, a little noisy. We had a great time!"
7126,"El lugar es ideal para conocer Chicago. Ubicado en un barrio tranquilo, bonito y seguro, cerca de muchos bares y restaurantes.
Muy cerca del centro con buena conexiÃ³n de transporte pÃºblico. Internet fuciona muy bien. Creo que es uno de los mejores barrios para alojarse en Chicago. Lo recomiendo 100%"
7126,"We came to Chicago for Riot Fest at Humboldt Park. Sarah's place was perfect. We walked to and from the park each day and never had any troubles. The apartment was neat and had everything we needed, including ponchos to protect us during a downpour. I hope we get the chance to come back in the future!"
7126,"This apartment is better than I could have imagined! The perfect neighborhood - quiet and beautiful but only a block away from multiple restaurants and bars. It's also a short walk up to Wicker Park, where you can find a stop for the el train. The apartment itself is small but not uncomfortably so - a full bathroom, kitchen, sitting area, and bedroom make it the perfect place to rest after a long day of sightseeing and bike riding. Sarah has made the place cozy and welcoming - we quickly felt at home upon arriving. It's really the perfect place to return to after a long day, one I hope to return to again!"
7126,"Sarah's place is perfect for a couple, and ideally located for neighbourhood walks and night life in the area. She was a very responsive host and even had the place ready early for us as we had an early flight! We loved being able to cook and enjoy relaxation time in the apartment in the evenings before heading back out. We'd stay again!"
7126,"Very nice and cozy apartment. Had everything I needed and communication with Sarah was excelent- she was always very fast to reply and very helpful. I was in Chicago for  the marathon, therefore I appreciated a lot that it was a very calm place to sleep, although very close to some nice restaurants and cafes. There is a bus that brings you to metro station and from there it is only a few minutes to the Loop. Even on early Sunday morning it took me less than 30 minutes from house to the entrance gate for the marathon. Highly recommended!"
7126,"Sarah's place was my first time to use AirBnB and she was very easy to work with even when I was new to the process.  The place itself was in a excellent location, and I think that's the biggest thing going for it.  I am big on breakfast, so every morning we stayed I was able to go out and try a new cafe within walking distance!  Getting to and from downtown Chicago was also a breeze with the closest CTA train station being only a 10 or so minute walk from the apartment.  This is an a great place to crash while visiting Chicago."
7126,"This apartment is in a great location. It's on a quiet residential street but very close to many bars, shops, and restaurants. The El is an easy walk from the house and cabs are very accessible. The apartment itself is cozy and had everything we needed for a long weekend in Chicago. Sarah was very accommodating in regards to letting us arrive early which was greatly appreciated. I can highly recommend this apartment and Sarah's hospitality. "
7126,Exelent stay. They were very friendly and helpful :)
7126,"Sarah was very helpful and even waited up for me as I was trying to find my way through Chicago to her place and got a bit lost.  The apartment was exactly as depicted in the pictures.  There really was not much in the way of comfortable seating nor space to unpack.  However, it was a full bath, kitchenette and (tight) bedroom with free parking close to downtown Chicago, private entry.  All things I was looking for.  The bed is, unfortunately, a futon.  This is clearly stated in her description and I should have paid more attention.  Perhaps when I was in my 20's or even 30's or 40's this wouldn't have mattered to me too much but now that I'm 54 I found it uncomfortable and difficult to sleep.  The neighborhood was quiet and I felt perfectly safe.  Thank you Sarah, maybe an egg crate foam pad will soften up that futon!"
7126,"A very homely and warm flat, and close enough to transport into the city. Really enjoyed my stay - thanks Sarah!"
7126,"We actually never met Sarah or Scott.  Their apartment in the rear of their home met our needs which were simply for a crash pad.  It was convenient to our son and daughter in law's apartment.  We appreciated being able to park on the street with the parking passes Sarah provided; in many parts of Chicago, parking is hard to find or ridiculously expensive.  The futon bed looked like it would be horribly uncomfortable but we slept pretty soundly.  No problems with outside sounds and we felt perfectly comfortable in the neighborhood.  The apt. was pretty much as described; there were no surprises.    "
7126,"A serviceable flat in a really great neighborhood. Sarah was out of town but made sure, via email contact, that we were able to get into her place okay. Everything is as advertised. "
7126,"Nice, warm spot in Chicago! "
7126,"This place is exactly what i needed. Cozy, warm and although is describe as TINY for me it was the perfect size!
I love the privacy. and the cleanliness of the place. 
I  know I will be back again and again >
"
7126,"Very convenient location, the surrounding neighborhood is super cute!"
7126,Very convenient for visiting the Ukrainian Village/Wicker Park area.
7126,Apartment fit the description with the large added benefit of free parking permits! It was in a great area of the city with easy to access transit and lots of bars and restaurants a stones throw away. Sarah was very quick to respond to all questions and queries- a great Airbnb experience!
7126,"Sarah was very accommodating when I got a ""little"" lost and came and picked me up which I really didn't expect - thank you again! 
The apartment itself is not as small as you may expect, very comfortable and warm with all amenities required. 
Location is great too, nice quiet suburb but only a short walk to West Division St cafe, food and shops and only 10 mins to Wicker Park which was pretty cool. lots more food options, stores and so on. 
Also well located for transport / trains, so all in all, I had a great stay and would return in the future. A pretty good first airbnb experience for me."
7126,Nice apartment perfect for 2 persons in a very agreable area with many bars and restaurants. Everything went smoothly and Sarah was a great host.
7126,"Sarah was a great host and we really enjoyed staying at the Tiny Studio Apartment. We took public transportation everywhere, and it was very easy. It's close to a few different bus lines and the L. The space was exactly as it was described, and it was easy to get the key. The lockbox on the door got jammed at one point, but they were home and came down right away to give us a spare and fix the lockbox. All in all a super positive, easy to navigate experience! We recommend it! Thanks Sarah (& family)!"
7126,Great  location. Nice place. 
7126,"Our stay at Sarah's apartment was wonderful! It was located close to public transportation and the surrounding area had plenty of shops and restaurants in walkable distance. Sarah was even nice enough to let us use her dryer after we got stuck out in a thunderstorm!

The listing is accurate. The space is small but all the facilities work well. We mostly used it to sleep and as a resting spot between outings; it worked perfectly for that!"
7126,"Great location for exploring Chicago and a good spot for 1 person to stay for a few days. (Tip: sleep on the right side of the futon). The host, Sarah, is very attentive and helpful. I appreciated the ease of check in/ out as there is a lock box to get the key."
7126,"Sarah's apartment was airbnb at its best. It's a great value for the location; there was so much to do within walking distance. The train stop was close by when we wanted to go into downtown. The place being small didn't phase us at all. Though we unfortunately didn't get to meet her, Sarah was meticulous about giving us check in information, internet code and parking passes. Great host, great place. We'll definitely be back."
7126,Apartment conforme Ã  la description dans un quartier a la fois vivant et calme on a Ã¨tÃ¨ completement independant mais Sarah et son Mari ont etait attentif et chaleureux! Great  place to stay!
7126,The appartment perfectly fit the description. It's good for a stay at 1 or 2. The neighborhood is really charming and calm. If needed you ll find plenty of informations and books about Chicago in the appartment.
7126,"The listing description was accurate. The host's response rate to my questions was excellent. The neighborhood is very nice as it is near great restaurants, bakeries and etc. I did not have a car on this trip and it was great/convenient to have a place near public transit. 

This place is perfect if you are like me and only there to shower/sleep. The only (miniscule) caveats I had were that the WiFi was a little spotty and the bed (futon?) was a little hard.

Bottom line: If you are looking for fancy then skip this place. However if all you need is a secure place in a good/convenient location, get this place. I'd rent this place again. "
7126,"Sarah was very communicative before our arrival and during our stay. She was also very helpful in recommending things to do around Chicago, and especially around the Wicker Park area. 

The apartment was as the title describes: tiny. That's not necessarily a negative. This place is perfect for one or two people who just need a place to crash, but plan on exploring Chicago most of the time. That was our plan, and this little apartment fit our needs perfectly. It's in walking distance to the Wicker Park area, the ""L"", and close enough to Downtown that a cab or Uber ride isn't too expensive. The street is quiet and the entire neighborhood is quaint and quite beautiful in places. We had a great stay in Chicago and are so thankful for Sarah for her role in that "
7126,"It's a small appartement as promised, well located in a nice trendy neighbourhood with shops and bakeries and coffeeplaces. The bed could be a little bit better though."
7126,"A cozy little apartment to use as a headquarters for a visit. I spent most of my nine days away, using the place only to sleep. I must say it was wonderfully quiet when I slept in. I also had a car, and while parking can be a complete pain in Chicago, there was always plenty of room within steps of the building."
7126,"Sarah was easy to get a hold of, and very professional as an AirBnB host. The room is definitely small, as advertised, and there is no television in the bedroom itself (which will surely not be a problem for many). The Roku worked well, but the comfortable seating is limited in the kitchen, which is where the television is located. This is only really important after a long day of walking, but was still something worth noting for us. We never had the chance to meet Sarah, but that was never a problem as she has everything set up perfectly. The internet works, but is slower than most will probably be accustomed to. The area is beautiful, and a quick, easy walk to the blue line of the bus system (a bit further, about a 15 minute walk, from the metro). 

The only downside to the room has to the bed itself, which is a futon that feels way past its prime. It definitely took a toll on my back, but I probably could have fallen asleep on the ground after all the walking through the city, haha! 

Come in expecting Sarah's claim of a ""tiny studio"" to be just that, and you should be satisfied. Bed could use some updating, but the bathroom is great, in both size and cleanliness. It was a pleasure to stay in Sarah's apartment, and Wicker Park and Ukrainian Village are excellent places to walk around. This comes highly recommended."
7126,We had a great stay at Sarah's studio! The location was fantastic in a very nice neighborhood that was walkable and close to public transit. The studio itself was cozy and had everything we could possibly need for a short stay. I would definitely look to stay here again the next time I visit Chicago!
7126,"Sarah was very responsive though email.  When I arrived she provided all the information to find, and access her studio.  I was able to check in early and check out late.  The studio is near a downtown strip, so I could walk to restaurants, bars, and grocery stores.  The Damen (o'hare) station was nearby too.
Thank you, Sarah!"
7126,"Sarah's place was great! Small, yes, but in a welcoming, cozy way that was great to come back to after a long day of walking around. The neighborhood is fantastic â€“ tons of bars and places to eat, plus it's super quiet at night and blocks from the bus/train. She was a totally welcoming and accommodating host; I couldn't have asked for more for my first Airbnb experience."
7126,"This apartment was exactly what we needed. It is definitely small (yay truth in advertising!) and the neighborhood is extremely safe, convenient and REALLY cool. It was super easy to get Divvy bikes, the train, busses or cabs. Sarah gave us all the info we could possibly need, and we didn't even see her during our stay. The apartment was clean, cozy and comfortable. We couldn't have asked for anything more!"
7126,"The apartment is in the best (my favorite) neighborhood of Chicago, walking distance from great restaurants and the L-station. Milk&Honey cafe is great (as recommended by Sarah). Very happy we stayed here.
The apartment really is not that tiny as I expected, and everything you might need is provided (books, towels etc.). The only thing is that the apartment could use some cleaning. "
7126,"We spent the weekend in this studio. We visited the day and we were there only to sleep. This small apartment really suit our expectations, does need us no more. Our host was very available to answer all of our questions by mail before coming. We also appreciated his advice and his kindness. We weren't too far from the metro stops and we were able to easily reach the down-town."
7126,"Perfect.  Super great little spot- just what I needed.  And so close to Empty Bottle, Lockdown, and a minutes from Wicker Park.  So convenient and the price was right. Thank you!!!!!"
7126,"We had a great stay at Sarah and Scott's.  Not only is the apartment well furnished and cozy, but the area is within walking distance of so many great spots.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
7126,"Staying at this apartment was seamless. Sarah was very communicative and responsive. The apartment is very small and old inside, but the location is wonderful & that's what you really need for a short trip! The only negative thing I would say is that the bed was not comfortable. I would reccommend a foam pad for it, definitely. And make sure you wait for the hot water for a while. I really appreciate Sarah being so accommodating with our check out time. It was a nice experience. Thank you!"
7126,"We loved staying at Sarah's place. The apartment is very private and had everything we needed, the small size didn't bother us at all. I loved the area - it's quiet and homey and at the same time Wicker park is just a few blocks away with restaurants, shops and bars. 
If you're visiting during winter: Bring slippers, because the floor is pretty cold!"
7126,"Listing was accurate, the neighborhood was fantastic. Restaurants, bars, and cafes within a few minutes walk. I had some trouble with the Wifi (would only let me connect phone or laptop, not both) and cut off or slowed down frequently. Other than that, very comfortable. Definitely not large enough for more than one or two people, but I was mostly out and about so this worked out great. "
7126,Great place
7126,I really enjoyed my stay here. The apartment was actually slightly bigger than I was initially expecting and very easy to get to. The neighborhood was very pleasant and it was very easy to walk to a large number of fantastic places to eat. Parking was also painless and made our lives during our stay very easy. Sarah responded very quickly to any questions we had during the weekend. I loved it and would definitely love to stay here again.
7126,Sarah was a great host - very responsive and helpful. The space overall  is great for one or two people - very clean and close to lots of great restaurants and bars as well as public transport. We had a lovely stay! 
7126,"Sarah responded to my questions quickly, offered to help us coordinate parking, and did a final check-in the day before our trip.  The apartment was exactly as described and in a great neighborhood.  Lots of nearby restaurants & bakeries, and we were able to walk or take the bus/train anywhere we wanted to go.  This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was great!"
7126,"This small apartment is located in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. Walkability is excellent with restaurants and busses and the blue line close by.
Furnishings are uncomfortable so don't expect that it is a place where you can sit and relax after a long day."
7126,"This apartment suited our needs for our short trip to Chicago, and is in a great location! Sarah made us feel welcomed by a binder with tons of info/tips about the neighborhood and city, and it was nice to have a snack and coffee ready to brew. There are many nice and interesting things in the apartment such as beautiful quilts on the walls, and enough nature sounds tapes to last a while. The apartment was as described and is best for one or two people. It was also nice to have easy street parking and access to many bars and restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk."
7126,"This space at the ground floor of Sarahs house is a great little place to spend a vacation! And we liked the area too, Ukrainian village feels like a nice neighborhood. We enjoyed our stay very much! /C & B"
7126,"The neighborhood was great and yes, it was  a tiny apartment as stated.  We never met Sarah but could hear them occasionally.  It was a pretty quiet place.   The apartment was fairly clean and the wifi,water and utilities were fine. ( 2 out of the 4 burners worked)  The fridge was a dorm fridge which we didn't except and the seating was not great.  A loveseat would have been really great. A blind was broken and the bedroom was stuffed with a bed and tiny table.  Nothing else fit in there. I think there are easy and inexpensive ways to greatly improve this apartment.  We received a parking ticket for 60.00 for parking on the wrong side of the street one night as we didn't know about the street cleaning.  Sarah kindly provided us with a letter to appeal this but this is something she should have been aware of. The tourist brochures are quite outdated ( 2010,11) and there were no pots for cooking; just 2 frying pans.  The bed was an older  futon and not very comfortable. I think this place needs a little love.  I booked this spot as there are many great reviews but I can't agree with them."
7126,We had a great stay at Sarah's place. It is a really cute studio that is close to Division and Damen in the Wicker Park/Ukrainian Village area. I would definitely recommend Sarah to anyone looking to spend time in this area!
7126,"Sarah was wonderful and really helpful and accommodating. The apartment was perfect, nothing fancy, but had everything I needed. You can't beat the location. Quiet, safe, on a lovely leafy residential street, with many restaurants and shops just a block away. I have stayed there twice and will definitely be back. "
7126,"The apartment location is in a very good area, with easy access to public transport and restaurants/bars. The apartment was clean and cozy and had all the utilities we could have possibly needed for our short stay. Sarah was a very friendly and helpful host. I would definitely stay here again if I come to Chicago."
7126,"Cozy, beautiful neighborhood with a great walking life. The place was perfect for a weekend!"
7126,Sarah was helpful in answering all questions prior to arrival. The apartment is quaint and in a beautifully unique neighborhood. It's a short walk to the train station. She provided a parking permit for time we were there. 
7126,"This place had everything we needed. While it is small, it didn't really matter since we spent little time there. The bed/futon isn't bad if you don't mind a more firm surface for sleeping. Neighbourhood and location is great. The only issue was that the wifi was sometimes spotty, especially in the bedroom."
7126,Great appartment for 2. Good location (bus stop to the corner and subway just 10 min walk). Easy parking also which is a plus. There was also many good restaurant in the area. Would definitely stay there again.
7126,"This was a great place to stay for our trip to Chicago. The description is accurate and Sarah was a friendly and helpful host. We absolutely loved the area, so many great places to eat and very easily accessible by subway and bus. I would highly recommend staying here! "
7126,Great place and Sarah was really good at communicating. Sad to leave.
7126,"This was a great place for our short stay in Chicago.  Although it is not set up to spend time in, we were there for the city and only needed somewhere to sleep and make breakfast, in a convenient location, so this tiny studio fit the bill.  The futon bed was comfortable enough for two, and there were plenty of towels and extra blankets.  Sarah was a very responsive host, with plenty of helpful and clear information, delivered in a timely manner.  It looks almost exactly like it does in the pictures."
7126,"My stay at Sarah's apartment was great! She made me feel very welcome and was very responsive to my requests. Everything was very clean, and the description was very accurate. It is a nice cozy little place for two people. The neighborhood was very nice and clean as well. There were many restaurants and bars near by which was very convenient. The transit system to the city center was also close by and easy to use. 

We had a great stay. I would definitely stay here again!"
7126,"Great little spot for a few days in Chicago! Nice and quiet, private, and our own side entrance. Everything was exactly as Sarah listed. Great location for getting places and very near to a few trendy bars and restaurants (and the best hole in the wall Mediterranean spot ever!). We spend most of our time out of the apartment and I would recommend that because of the size and lack of couch, but would definitely stay here again!"
7126,"This apartment was ideally located for me. I was able to easily walk to several awesome bars, restaurants, and stores from the apartment. Easy walk to the Blue Line, and lots of convenient public transportation all around, as well as a cheap cab ride back from the Loop. The host made check-in and parking very easy for us. There's a small a/c in the bedroom which really helped make us comfortable on the muggy days. My main criticisms are that it seems like the place could use a deep cleaning, and the futon mattress was very hard."
7126,"Had a great stay in Chicago. This apartment was very convenient. Quiet neighborhood yet right next to Division Street (lots of bars and restaurants) which was best of both worlds. Easy walk to Wicker Park area and the El. 
Sarah was very flexible and accommodating. Clean apartment. Small but still perfect for 2 people. "
7126,"I cannot stress how much we LOVED Sarah's apartment. It is perfect for visiting the city, has everything we could ever need and, in our opinion, wasn't that tiny - we've stayed in smaller! The location is perfect too for exploring everywhere and getting in off the freeway. Sarah kindly left us parking permits and the street parking was easy. The neighbourhood is safe and beautiful - Wicker Park is so much fun, we wish we had stayed longer. Want to give it 10 stars!!"
7126,"Neighborhood was very nice, close to many restaurants and a pretty short walk to the bus and train. Everything was as pictured and described. Didn't really meet her but sarah was very prompt is responding to text/email. It was a very nice place for a short stay for 2 people."
7126,Very nice place to stay! Good location! Easy access to train and bikes! Clean appartment with interesting books :) comfortable bed even with two ppl! Nice bars and restaurants in walking distance!
7126,Sarah's place was tiny and cute! Close to the metro and easy to find. The neighborhood is full of lively eateries and bars. I adore Chicago and this neighborhoodly area just close enough to everything makes you feel right at home but you can still pop down to the hustle bustle of the city very easily 
7126,"The apartment is advertised as 'tiny'. As a European we would just say 'small'. In general, rough and ready. Seating at table is a narrow old church pew, characterful but uncomfortable. Bathroom ok. Cooking facilities basic, but for those who prefer to eat out there are plenty of local options. 
Electric cables hanging about the kitchen sink is not only negligence from the hosts point of view, undermining its ugliness but also the lack of consideration to a minimum SAFETY Regulations.  Kitchen cabinets without bolts so one leaves one nails every time one  wants to open them. The cooker with two of its five bolts missing, is another nuisance. To produce 2 frying pans and 1/2 pint ceramic saucepan to cook with, is not being caring. It is not for the guest to be after the host asking for items that should be in the place in its first instance. We have to ask for a saucepan to make soup, other to prepare pasta and some oven ware items to cook with. The hosts met these demands. a thus we can say that the hosts are responsive. 
Overall it's not very comfortable, but set against that it is fairly central, 10 mins brisk walk to subway then 15 mins to downtown. Important is - the area feels safe, and one block away are lots of bars, restaurants, plenty people around in the evenings."
7126,"Place was perfectly described and well situated, as other review indicate. Sarah was a great help in obtaining directions and nearby restaurant suggestions. It was a very pleasant stay."
7126,"Communication with Sarah was easy, the apartment was clean and comfortable, more spacious than the listing implied, and very well located. "
7126,I enjoyed my stay at Sarah's. The apt was well described and comfortable.
7126,"We really enjoyed our stay at Sarah's appartment. It was cozy and felt like home. The neighborhood is lovely and quiet, with many restaurants and bars close to the appartment. It was a little expensive for us but we would stille recommend this place as it is really easy to go to both the airport and downtown Chicago from there. 
Thanks Sarah !"
7126,"The location is fantastic, the unit was clean. It is attached to the rest of the house, and seems to be separated by some hanging blankets and tall dresser barricade. Not exactly my idea of ""entire"" but I still enjoyed my stay.

The description is accurate otherwise. A nice neighborhood, close to transit."
7126,"The description of this place is perfectly accurate. The location was super convenient and the neighborhood was great. Easy to walk around and get to public transit. The neighborhood is quiet, but right by a lot of nightlife. The place is cozy, perfect for one or two people. It would be small if you want to just hang around and not explore the city, but why would you want to do that? Sarah was communicative, helpful and flexible, so logistics were a breeze. Bonus was a nice little collection of CDs and books in the apartment, including some great stuff about Chicago!"
7126,"Awesome visit to a beautiful and fun part of Chicago. Sarah was welcoming and very proactive about helping us find the apartment and get settled. The apartment was just as described. The neighborhood was a true mix of fun, lively restaurants and cafes on the one hand, and calm, quiet residential streets on the other hand."
7126,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Sarah's. It was exactly as described; in fact she provided a plenty of needed essentials (towels) which were initially crossed out from the list. Public transportation is in walking distance from the studio. We had nice breakfasts in the area, there are many restaurants around. "
7126,"The apartment was great. Sarah provided excellent instructions, and I was able to get in/out of the studio apartment without issues. I didn't have any issues during my stay, but Sarah remained available to answer questions, and she did provide daily parking vouchers to allow for street parking (which can be challenging on the weekends, but I was able to find parking nearby). The apartment was clean, with a fairly comfortable bed, bathroom/shower, and a stove (I didn't do any cooking). Overall, great place, would definitely recommend to others."
7126,Sarah was great!
7126,Nice place. Good neighborhood. 
7126,"The studio was perfect for a visit to Chicago. It's in a great (IMO - BEST) neighborhood in Chicago and easy to get anywhere in the city from there. The studio is as described and comfortable for 1-2 people. Easy check-in and check out. I'd stay there again when returning to Chicago. 
"
7126,Sarah's instructions made checking myself into this awesome hideout a cinch! It's a super cozy apartment with interesting personal touches. Just what I needed.
7126,Cozy and very convenient. Exactly what we wanted. Thanks! 
7126,"We were very happy with Sarah's apartment. It was very clean, perfectly located and lovely. Sarah herself was very flexible and accomodating. It couldn't have been better. Thank you !!!
"
7126,"Sarah was a wonderful host and everything was perfect! It was easy to check in, and everything was as expected!"
7126,"I loved this neighbourhood, and Sarah's apartment was just what we needed. Her warning is true, it is quite small, but it was a perfect landing pad for us to use to explore the neighbourhood. "
7126,"El apartamento es excelente, pequeÃ±o pero muy comodo para dos personas!! Y el barrio hermoso! Ah y todo funcionaba de maravilla."
7126,Sarah's apartment was just like on the pictures and got everything we needed for a short and relaxed stay. The place is very nice and quiet and good to reach - there is a bus stop just around the corner. 
7126,"Description is accurate - place is tiny!  Location was convenient with easy access to public transportation and neighborhood was pleasant.  It was cold in the apartment even after the heat was turned on.  Seating in the main area composed of what seemed like an old church pew and some plastic chairs -- would have preferred something more comfortable after coming back from walking around the city.  The ""bed"" was a futon (as described) and not too comfortable either.  "
7126,Sarah is very responsive to any inquiries that you might have and she was flexible with my check-in and check-out times which I appreciated a lot. The apartment is as described and was perfect for what my friend and I needed on our visit to Chicago. The location was great â€“ it was one block away from many different restaurants and bars which was helpful on last minute runs. Thereâ€™s a bus stop a block away and the blue line station is a 15 minute walk from the apartment. The walk is not bad at all because itâ€™s a nice neighborhood and a hip area and you get to see many individuals out and about. I felt very safe walking through the area at night and the neighbors nearby were friendly. I had a good experience and would recommend Sarahâ€™s apartment.
7126,Exactly what we needed. Sarah made everything effortless and comfortable. Thanks so much! We'll be back soon. 
7126,"This place was in an awesome location! Only one block south of Division and less than 15 minutes from the nearest blue line station. 
The description is 100% accurate. It is a small sleeping space but the living room/kitchen is pretty big. "
7126,"Had a great time in this apartment very comfortable and perfect for what we needed, close to downtown area and good neighborhood. The apartment was clean and it also looked bigger in person. The host was very nice for letting us check out late which was very helpful for us since we had a late flight. I totally recommend staying there. If I ever come back to Chicago will definitely book here again. Thank you!"
7126,"Wonderful stay at Sarah's!  Perfect location and the listing was just as described.  Perfect for a couple who are in Chicago to explore!!  Easy to get to from the airport and easily accessible to public transportation.  We also took advantage of their CD collection! Overall, had an excellent experience and would definitely stay again!  "
7126,I came in for two days to go to Neocon. Place was perfect for my needs. Neighbourhood was nice and lots of good food options a couple blocks away. 
7126,"The studio was very nice for staying. Great neighborhood, easy to go anywhere in the Chicago, easy to check-in & -out. I would strongly recommend this studio to someone finding a cozy place in Chicago for staying."
7126,Sarah's apartment was very quaint and exactly what we needed for a couple days in Chicago. Great location!
7126,"The overall location of the place was ideal it was close to everything restaurants, bars, Wicker Park, the blue line subway line is only about 10 minutes or so away walking. Downtown Chicago thru uber was no more than 15 minutes away and the blue line train got us from near Millenium Park to the apartment in about 30 minutes. We also enjoyed watching tv thru the Roku it worked perfectly and it does get hot in Chicago during the summer and the AC in the room cooled us off perfectly. The location is actually very quiet for the most part the only noise we ever heard was the neighbors kids playing in the front or in their yard but it didn't bother us. Despite all the good things about the apartment we did find a few things that weren't to our liking buts it's totally our point of view everyone else may not feel the same way as we did. First thing was the wifi signal strength it seemed to be at its strongest inside of the bathroom for some reason in the bedroom I got maybe a bar or 2 of wifi and it was very spotty so be aware of that. The overall cleanliness of the apartment wasn't to our liking we found at least 3 spiders in the bathroom which didn't bother me but scared the life out of my girlfriend. The futon was uncomfortable to us buts it's a futon not a mattress so you decide how you feel about it. I actually text Sarah as soon as we arrived I thought I was going to get a chance to meet her but never did and never received a reply but I figured she was busy so I didn't feel bad about it. It would have been nice to have received some reccomendations from our host of what to do and/or see in Chicago but again that's how we felt I believe she does state it in the description that there is a good chance you won't cross paths with her during your trip. Overall, our stay wasn't terrible just a few things that bothered us but honestly the location is unbeatable and it did have a home away from home appeal once you got used to it. Plus the private entrance was definitely a plus for us."
7126,"Sarah made our two night stay a breeze in what is a very beautiful neighborhood of Chicago. Checking in was as easy as I've ever seen and available parking permits were a great help. I love the location, extremely walkable just as advertised and we felt completely safe. The bed is a bit thin which wasn't an issue for me but I think if you're used to a thick supple mattress you may have an issue. The place could do with a bit of a deep cleaning but other than that we have no complaints, when it comes to ""bang for your buck"" you aren't going to find something better in this neighborhood. Sarah is extremely responsive so if you have any issues I'm sure she'll be all over it."
7126,The stay was great the room was quiet and well air conditioned. The perfect size for a stay in the big city. Sarah was great and very helpful with all of our inquiries. 
7126,Thank you Sarah! We had a great time in your place. Thank you also for your recommendations about your neighborhood. We will definitely recommend your place to our friends!
7126,"Sarah's studio apartment was a great place to stay for a long weekend trip to Chicago with my husband. The description is accurate in that it is a small space, but it was cozy and clean, and just enough room for the two of us. The apartment is on a quiet, tree-lined street, which was nice to come home to. It's just a few blocks from restaurants, bars and stores in the Ukrainian Village neighborhood, and since public transit was right around the corner we were able to get around the city without a car. Check in and check out were super easy and straightforward, and Sarah was quick to respond. We loved our stay here and would highly recommend it!"
7126,We had a wonderful time at Sarah's Tiny Studio. We had everything we needed and more. Would highly recommend it to fellow travelers and couples looking for a getaway.
7126,Sarah was very responsive and the value and location were great! Overall a very good stay.
7126,We had a great time at Sarah's. Location was quiet and just a short ride away from anywhere we wanted to go. Would highly recommend it!
7126,"Sarah always made sure that we had what we needed to be comfortable and I genuinely could not think of one piece of negative feedback. She always responded promptly if we had questions or needed anything. The apartment was adorable and it felt like a home away from home. It was a great neighborhood as well! Super close to a plethora of great restaurants, unique stores, and the Blue Line which made it really convenient to travel to downtown Chicago."
7126,"Great location and Sarah makes the unit very comfy! I slept very well, and loved that Sarah provided so much, including coffee and a coffee maker! I really enjoyed my stay and I'd highly recommend Sarah's place!"
7126,"This is a cozy apartment in a great neighborhood. It had everything we needed and was exactly how it is described. Next time we go to Chicago we'd love to stay there again, and we will recommend it to our friends!! "
7126,"With local accommodations for coffee/dining/bars just two blocks away, this cozy little spot is a perfect middleground of access and private seclusion. 

All the necessary amenities of home were provided, with great water pressure in the shower!! It's the little things that make a difference."
7126,"We had a really nice stay at Sarah's place. The location is great - easy walk to the Blue Line, and many cool shops, restaurants and bars. The neighbourhood is quiet and feels very safe. We didn't actually meet Sarah while we were there but she provided all of the information for us to check in and out very easily. Thanks for a great stay!"
7126,Everything about this place screams hidden gem! Sarah communicated mostly with my partner during the planning stages however he reported how lovely interacting with our host was! The place is exactly what she described in the listing and I appreciate that! You will have everything you need here and there are some really great restaurants that are just walking distance. Would love to stay here again!
7126,"Sarah is AMAZING!  I cannot praise her enough.  She was overly helpful, so kind, and so generous!  Everything I contacted her about prior and during was responded to within hours.  It was so great to have someone who genuinely cared about their guests and made sure we had everything we needed.  Her place was in the perfect location for what we were in Chicago for.  We were expecting to be in tight quarters since she describes the place as ""Tiny"" but it was bigger than we expected.  Also, the bed was in a small separate room, which was nice, since we were expecting it to be a studio"
7126,"The space was as expected, we wanted to just sleep there the two nights. But, the mattress was quite bad for us at least, and we couldn't sleep the first night, so we decided to cancel the second one. Sarah didn't give any problem and she said that will buy a new mattress for the next guests. So, I think with the new mattress the place is great to stay there for a few days if you need a place to sleep."
7126,"Sarah did a great job communicating with me and her instructions on how to get into the apartment were easy to follow. The photos were accurate and it was a very cozy place to stay. I didn't get to explore the neighborhood because I was in town for a music festival, but it looks like a great neighborhood to explore. I definitely recommend staying here."
7126,"Pros: Sarah was very flexible about check in and check out. The neighborhood was really awesome and walking distance to so many restaurants and bars. Felt very safe there. The shower had good water 
pressure.
Cons: if you have T-Mobile you will have absolutely no reception in the house to make calls or otherwise. The wifi is super spotty and unreliable. You may not think you will be surfing the web much but even just to get information like directions or weather was a huge hassle with the unreliable wifi. The tv was so old the screen constantly shakes like a vibration going through it which can leave you dizzy if you try to watch anything on it. Lastly, but probably most importantly was the terrible uncomfortable bed. We were basically laying on wooden boards. It got so bad that we went to target to buy a mattress padding but even that did not help. Woke up sore everyday."
7126,"For everyone who doesn't have time to read all of this: This place is awesome for a couple or friends who want to do lots of sightseeing. No apartment to spend a lot of time in and the bed is not very comfortable. Excellent location though! 

Before we arrived we've been in contact with Sarah, the host, about our arrival and departure and she was super friendly and helpful! She told us the easiest way to get there from the airport (Metro Blue Line and short walk) and let us check-in super early (8am) and check-out super late (6pm) which made our stay so much easier!!! Thanks again, Sarah!

With her description it was easy to find the apartment and to get into it. The apartment is super small, dark and not very fancy, but totally fine to spend some nights in. It is super clean, so we felt comfortable, but the futon is kind of hard and uncomfortable. 

From the apartment it is super easy to get to the city center and to the airport, so it was perfect for us! AND the area has very nice restaurants and bars you can hang out! We felt super comfortable walking home from the metro station in the night (two girls). 

Thank you so much for hosting, Sarah :)"
7126,"Loved this place. Great value. Stayed in Chicago for 3 days. We were new to lyft and Uber, and with the free credits we got, it was cheaper to use that then buy CTA passes for 2 people ($40). Very close to things. The most we paid for one Lyft was $5. Walked to the store several times and a deli. Good location, great hosts. "
7126,"Loved the location! Such a lovely, lively neighborhood! "
7126,This was great! The location is great for walking around and getting to transit. Just enough space for a couple of people. Sarah was very helpful.
7126,"Le logement de Sarah est parfait pour un sÃ©jour Ã  Chicago: trÃ¨s bon rapport qualitÃ©-prix, un appartement confortable, un quartier trÃ¨s agrÃ©able. C'Ã©tait parfait."
7126,"The location is perfect. Very convenient to go to the airport and downtown with the rail system.  Walkable distance from Damen station on the blue line, Wicker Park and many restaurants, bars and cafes. As for the place, it was clean and the bed was comfy. It looks exactly like the pictures."
7126,"Perfect apartment for the two of us. Couldn't have dreamed of a better location, we were so close to everything we could want or need! Trips downtown were fast and easy from the apartment, and we loved how it felt like home, not a hotel. If you get a chance, stay here!!! "
7126,"Nice little cozy place, makes you feel like home. Good cafes and convenience stores in walk-able distance and you get Uber/Lyft in few minutes. Sarah is a very friendly and helpful host! Would love to stay again!!"
7126,"Great host. I didn't personally stay with her but my parents said she was a wonderful host, very respectful, and very responsive. Highly recommended."
7126,"Sarah's place was great. It was the perfect spot for me as a solo traveler. It was a 10 minute walk to the Damen Blue Line station, 10 minute bus ride to the United Center for my Bulls games and very close to grocery, restaurants and nightlife. The perfect home base. Sarah was a great host. She was away on vacation for the majority of my stay but checked up on me before and after check in to make sure everything was okay. A pleasure to deal with even if we didn't get the chance to meet in person. I will definitely stay here again during future visits to the city. Thanks again for everything. "
7126,"This is a perfect studio apartment -- cozy, beautifully decorated (much nicer looking than the photos here show!), very private, in a great neighborhood, with ample street parking. Sarah was responsive and helpful, and left a series of Chicago books on the studio shelves which we found helpful. Highly recommend!"
7126,Great place!
7126,Fantastic location and a great home base. Had all the thing you need for a place to bunk down at the end of the night. Shower runs warm and water tastes like nothing. Fantastic neighborhood and never more than a $20 lift ride to any major attraction!
7126,Seamless stay at Sarah's! Great location and all the amenities you need.  
7126,"Clean, 10-15 minutes from downtown, great neighborhood. "
7126,"The place was as described, in a quiet, but very centrally located and convenient location. We were able to walk to wicker park, bucktown, and noble square. Catching a bus to the train was easy as well. Thanks Sarah! "
7126,"Location was great, I enjoyed the neighboring yoga studio and a couple of shops. The unit is very cozy. It wasn't quite as functional for a business traveler as I'd hope, but I think for the average sightseer, it would be a great option."
7126,This place was really cute and close all shops and downtown. Totally exceeded our expectations! I would definitely recommend this place for 2 people! 
7126,Very nice small studio. Centrally located to many great attractions.
7126,"Location is great if you're looking to spend time in Ukrainian Village or Wicker Park. Train was about a 15 minute walk. If you're on a budget and want a private apartment, this is probably your best bet. "
7126,"Sarah's place is great! The neighborhood is lovely, and there are plenty of shops and restaurants a block up. It's a short and pleasant walk to the Blue Line, so it's an easy connection to the rest of the city. The space is perfect for two, and everything was cozy and comfortable. Thanks for a wonderful stay! "
7126,"Great location, cozy place! "
7126,"Great spot, close to lots of awesome restaurants and the blue line. Made our stay very easy."
7126,Fantastic value in an incredible neighborhood. Perfect for exploring the city!
7126,Great host and good location
7126,"Cute, clean, and quiet--perfect for a couple or two friends who are out in the city all day and need a calm place to rest at night. Love the neighborhood and convenient location to Division bars and restaurants! Would recommend and would stay here again."
7126,"Does exactly what it says on the tin. Small but just right for one person, maybe two, for a short stay. Clean and comfortable. Great location."
7126,"Sarah's place is exactly as it appears, tiny but perfectly located to explore Chicago! Lots of fun bars, cafes and restaurants in the area (try big star and wyrmhole) as well as easy access to trains and city bikes. Sarah is also incredibly accommodating and very reliable at replying if you have an issue! We highly recommend staying at her place xx Tori & Nick "
7126,Cozy and cost effective. Felt like I was staying over a friend's house 
7126,"Sarah's place was great, its small but really cozy! It's also in a wonderful location, the neighborhood is a lot of fun, tons of great places to get dinner and drinks at. Once the night falls, def check out the Empty Bottle for some music, it's in walking distance. "
7126,Perfect home base for exploring Chicago. 
7126,"Sarah's place was great!  Just what we needed for our stay in Chicago. So close to so many amazing restaurants and bars, yet still in a delightful, beautiful and quiet residential area. Also very easy to get downtown from! 

If you're heading to Chicago, Sarah's place is a great place to call ""home""! "
7126,"Sarah's home is very pleasant, accessible, and provides all amenities needed for a convenient stay in Chicago!"
7126,"Great location, exactly as advertised. Sarah was always very responsive to any questions. Thanks again! "
7126,"Great neighborhood, gracious host, beautiful little space. Would happily stay here again."
7126,"Very cozy and cute studio apartment! Sarah was very communicative and the location was perfect, so many restaurants nearby to chose from! Definitely would suggest staying here for a quick trip!"
7126,"Una casa molto piccola, ma ubicata in un buon quartiere, pieno di locali e ristoranti, a circa un kilometro dalla blue line. Buona la dotazione della cucina ( macchina del gas, microonde e tostapane) ma forse troppi soprammobili tolgono spazio prezioso. Fortunatamente abbiamo risolto dei dubbi da soli, perchÃ© la host, che avevamo cercato di contattare via sms non ci ha mai risposto e non l'abbiamo proprio mai vista!!!"
7126,Thanks Sarah for allowing us to stay at your place.
7126,Sarah's place is the perfect space for a couple or solo traveler to explore Chicago and the Ukrainian village. The apartment is super cozy and has a comfortable bed with all of the accomedities you need. Within walking distance you can find several highly rated resturaunts and cocktail bars. An Uber ride to downtown is less than $10.
7126,"This apartment is in a great neighborhood! Easy to walk to shops and restaurants. And public transportation is close by. I drove and parking wasn't really an issue, even when they were filming on the street when I was there. Thanks Sarah for providing the parking passes!"
7126,Great place in a great neighborhood. I hope to stay again.
7126,"Place was clean and very quiet.  Access to public transportation was excellent too.  The host, Sarah, was always accessible.  She was very communicative and flexible since I needed to delay my check-out time a bit."
7126,Very convenient to the wonderful neighborhood.  The parking passes were a great convenience for us and the bed was very comfortable!  An excellent retreat from adventures in the city.
7126,Nice place for a quick stay in Chicago. Close to lots of bars and restaurants and accessible by public transit.
7126,This was my first stay via Airbnb and Sarah was a great first host! She was good at communicating with me and she gave great suggestions on what to do in the city and the Ukrainian Village. I enjoyed staying at her little apartment! It was so homey! I hope to be back soon!
7126,2nd time staying here. Was great and had no problems.
7126,Had a nice short stay at Sarah's place during a recent visit to Chicago. Good location in Wicker Park near lots of shops and the Blue Line is only about 15 minutes away. Would stay again!
7126,"Quaint little place. We enjoyed every minute of it. Thanks Sarah.

Warm regards,
Jim"
7126,"Can't go wrong. Definitely a 1-2 person place, it's tiny, but all you're going to do is sleep there anyway because you'll be out in a great neighborhood having fun."
7126,Great place and super convenient! We felt right at home!
7126,"A cute little place in a lovely neighborhood. Like the description says, it is a small space perfect for 1 or 2 people as there is just one bed. The location is great! There are many good restaurants nearby. I highly recommend checking out the host's local guidebook recommendations. It is a 15 minute walk to the blue line or a shorter walk to a bus that takes you right to the train. Generally about 30 minutes to the loop.  The host was very accommodating and was quick to respond to messages. Overall, we had a great time and would stay here again."
7126,"Sarahâ€™s place was perfect for a stay in Chicago. The apartment is very homey, comfortable and clean, and the location is great for walking to the blue line train, shops and restaurants. Easy check-in and Sarah is great at responding to any messages. Highly recommend this Airbnb!"
7126,"Sarah's place is perfect if you just need a place to sleep and want easy access to the city via public transit, particularly if you're traveling through O'Hare. Communication through AirBNB leading up to our trip was great, but for whatever reason, I had some difficulty getting in touch with Sarah while we were in Chicago. Check-in and check-out were simple. There were plenty of towels for our use, and the bed was comfortable. I'd stay here again."
7126,"Sarah's place is exactly what we needed for our weekend in Chicago. Though the space is small it totally worked for everything we needed for a weekend away. The area has tons of awesome food stops (on tops of the great ones that Sarah suggested) for way cheap if you look, the people were super nice, and even though it was FREEZING for NYE weekend, everything was perfect!"
7126,This place feels like a tiny home! Old books and tapes and CDs decorate the wall. Bed is comfortable and plenty big enough for two people. Sarah was very quick to respond to me and was a great host. Apartment was warm and the television had a Roku on it. The neighborhood is awesome and so quaint. You are within walking distance to some amazing restaurants and bars. This was a great stay! Highly recommend!
7126,Cozy spot in a perfect location. Would be happy to stay again.
7126,"We had a great time during our stay in Ukrainian Village. Great location and nice, cozy space."
7126,.
7126,"Like the header says, the place is small, but the space has all the needed amenities, check in was a breeze, parking was easy, and the location is great. Within a few blocks of a lot of great bars and restaurants."
7126,"The tiny studio apartment was just right for my solo trip to Chicago. The bed was very comfortable, and I slept really well each night. I would definitely stay here again on my own or with my spouse. Great location!"
7126,"Great small place. Worked perfectly for just myself. Quiet neighborhood and Sarah was very responsive. The space is eclectic and older, but very clean. No complaints and Iâ€™d stay again."
7126,"Sarahâ€™s place was clean, quiet and comfortable. Would recommend staying there."
7126,"Very comfortable little apartment! Nice amenities, great location. Great for short stays that donâ€™t require you spend a lot of time at home. Highly recommend for ambitious sight seers."
7126,"We came here for our honeymoon. Exactly as described in terms of size. Great location, around the corner from a lot of good food and markets. We had forgotten some things and were close to a 24hr CVS that was a very safe and well lit walk away. Very clean and soft bed. 

My only frustration was our entry. The door was harder to get into than described. The door seems to be broken and must be jiggled then lifted upwards in order to open. The keypad needs to be pushed into a click and reset every time you open or close it. After a long morning of traveling, we were tired and having trouble and couldnâ€™t reach the host after multiple calls to the phone provided."
7126,"I really enjoyed my stay. The location was phenomenal. I've been to Chicago over a dozen times, and it was my first time spending time in the area. Plenty of great places close by to eat, shop, or grab a drink. And it's an easy walk to the blue line. I walked quite a bit in my two days and felt very safe. 

I didn't spend much time in the apartment, but the bed was comfortable, and the room was nice and dark for sound sleeping. There were plenty of towels and utensils. The only item I used was the little microwave to reheat my leftover Pequod's Pizza, which is a place I highly recommend by the way. 

The only issue I had was unlocking the keypad. Sarah's husband happened to be leaving as I got there and he helped me out. 

Overall, I give it 5/5. Great location, great price, and it was exactly what I expected. "
7126,"Sarahâ€™s place was a wonderful little oasis in the city!  

Located on a quiet street, one block away from some great restaurants and shopping, we enjoyed having our own entrance - just like our own little apartment.  

The place is well-appointed and had everything we needed during our long weekend in Chicago.

We especially liked the Chicago-centric decor and plentiful books on Chicago (places and restaurants to visit)."
7126,"Sarahâ€™s place is as described, it is small but cozy. It had all of the things we needed during our visit plus a few. The neighborhood is very charming with great restaurants nearby - our â€œmust-eat-atâ€ suggestions are Whisk and Tryzub, they were delicious! "
7126,"Sarah's place really is as advertised, it is quite small (and that is coming from a New Yorker). My husband and I stayed for 3 nights and luckily we had good weather and were out of the apartment most of the trip, we really only used it as a place to crash after a long day of exploring. It is a cute little apartment, but def not very comfortable to just hang out in if you need a break. Big Star and other Wicker Park staples are a quick 15 min walk, but there are a bunch of little great places sprinkled around closer to the apartment, so the area was great to explore. I would recommend Sarah's place if you are visiting for a short time and have a busy itinerary. "
7126,Great location and easy check in. The place is very small but sufficient.  It was also very dusty. 
7126,This is a great little place to stay for a few nights! Super walkable to food and exploring :) 
7126,"This apartment is tiny as advertised but it's quiet (ground floor, rear of building, between two other close-packed Chicago homes) and the neighborhood is really fun.  Lots to do, lots of places to eat, and super easy access to transit.  Sarah was very responsive to questions through the Airbnb app.

Tip about the wifi: my older-model iPhone got the best connection in the bathroom and the little hallway next to it.  The connection didn't reach into the bedroom, so there isn't really a place to lounge and also browse online.  That's good though if you're doing an internet detox during your visit! (Also if you're on T-mobile don't count on getting service while inside the apartment)."
7126,Cozy studio in a great location. Sarah was very quick to respond and made the check in seamless!
7126,"I didnâ€™t meet Sarah..but we were able to communicate just fine. Her place was a welcome respite from the 95 temps in Chicago that week: cool, comfortable, and cheerfully decorated. Thank you, Sarah!"
7126,"Small but conveniently located apartment. Wicker Park is full of good eats, blue line access is walkable and can get you into down town easily and inexpensively."
7126,"Sarah's place was perfect for our overnight stay. Located in a stylish, safe neighborhood close to fun attractions!"
7126,"Adorable, quaint, clean. Great stay!"
7126,"This space is cute and quaint and in a super cool location. Itâ€™s right on the edge of Wicker Park which is teeming with restaurants and shops on W. Division and Milwaukee! Not the cleanest space Iâ€™ve been in, but I wasnâ€™t grossed out, and it is very functional! Delivery drivers and Lyft rides can find the location very easily."
7126,Can't beat the value.
7126,We had a great stay! The apartment was perfect for our weekend stay and the self check-in was great. The neighborhood was safe and lively. Overall great experience.
7126,"Nice little appartment. Perfect for a couple. Location is great, we really enjoyed Ukrainian village. The street is beautiful and very quiet but there are plenty of restaurants/bars within a 5 min walk. Sarah was a great host, very responsive."
7126,Stood here for about 5 days for lollapalooza. Great spot close to the blue line that took us to grant park and a whole bunch of places to eat/drink walking distance. Place is small but also very cozy at the same time. Perfect for a trip where youâ€™ll be out most of the time. Will be back here if Iâ€™m ever back in Chicago!
7126,"it is located in a wonderful neighbourhood 
for us it was a bit too much stuff inside.
it is small
we knew that, so this was ok
but it felt as if it was abandoned for a long time. 

really dusty.
smelled moisty
bed was fresh.
communication was great
"
7126,"So homey, right off of the buzzing Division St. Quiet and private. What a spot!"
7126,"If youâ€™re the type of person thatâ€™s â€œon the goâ€, then this is the place for you.  Inexpensive and within walking distance to all thatâ€™s happening on Division Street."
7126,"Sarahâ€™s place was great for a lone traveler. The neighborhood is really cute, with tons of restaurants and shops. Sarahâ€™s place had everything I needed for my time there. And an easy commute to the loop. Would highly recommend for people looking for a budget friendly, low key place to stay! "
7126,"This place was the worst Airbnb experience I ever had.  As soon as I got there I realized that the pictures from the listing were completely outdated.  The place itself was incredibly old and poorly maintained.  The floors were covered in dust and I ended up having to wear my shoes the entire time.  The paint on the walls were chipping.  I even found empty water bottles left by previous guests underneath the bed. 
The place is advertised to have WiFi but it only works in the bathroom.  The towels had gum stuck to them and the toiletries were all old and had caked on grime.  
On the second morning we had power issues and the hosts husband came by.  He was not apologetic or friendly.  In fact he came across as threatening.  Eventually I had to just leave the Airbnb and move to a hotel for the rest of my vacation and request a refund.  
This Airbnb ruined a good portion of my Labor Day weekend.  Please think twice before booking here."
7126,Great location just off Division street and a short distance away from the vibrant Wicker Park hub. Great value for the amount of time we stayed in Chicago.
7126,"We had a lovely stay at Sarah's place. It's in a great location with plenty of good food, coffee and drink options nearby. The area feels safe and comfortable day and night.

Its also an easy walk or taxi ride into other neighbourhoods and downtown if you want to go exploring.

Comfortable space with everything we needed for a short city break.

Would definitely reccomend!"
7126,"Exactly as expected - great location, but small.  Sarah was very hospitable and was able to get back with our requests super fast.  Because of her, we were able to travel without a pack n play for our 1 year old which is so awesome.  It was a little tight for our family of 3, but would be great for a couple."
7126,Sarahâ€™s place was exactly as expected. It is convenient to downtown - 15 min walk to train + a few stops or a quick ride. Very quiet neighborhood but super close to some fun restuarants and bars. We had everything we needed for our quick trip to Chicago.
7126,"We loved staying at Sarahâ€™s. It was so cozy and perfect for us. We were on the go a lot so we did hang out. Itâ€™s not a hang out spot but a place to sleep, shower and regroup. We enjoyed the walk to the apt and found the bus was even better to use to get the L. We will stay again. Sarah was so nice and quick to get back to us. The bed was so cozy."
7126,Perfectly clean and cozy feel. AMAZING location. The host responded quickly and was so accommodating for some last minute changes I needed to make. Was just a great experience in a great place.
7126,"This place was a great stay and is only a few quick stops on the Blue Line to the center of downtown. Also, there are some great restaurants in the area of the town. The neighborhood is peaceful and charming. I highly suggest it."
7126,This was our first ever experience with Airbnb and it was great! The location was super nice and not far from great restaurants and shops or downtown. The neighborhood was quiet and we felt extremely safe. It was quite small but itâ€™s perfect if itâ€™s just one or two people and you just need a place to crash for a night or two. Thanks Sarah!
7126,Awesome experience! Was close to CTA and the neighborhood was great.
7126,Outstanding place - extremely cozy and comfortable. Such a great location too!
7126,Truly perfect location for just about everything. cozy and quiet in the middle of the city.
7126,Sarah was accommodating and responsive. Her place was perfect for me and my boyfriend and conveniently located to the places we wanted to visit.
7126,Visited Chicago for New Years and had a wonderful trip. The location is fantastic and allows you to get around town easily. Plenty of eateries within walking distance and a lot of foot traffic in the area. The neighborhood is cute and a delight to travel through. Would definitely recommend if travelling by yourself or with a partner.
7126,Our stay was short and full.  Sarah made it easy to check-in and get settled.
7126,Sarah's place was great and in a really awesome location!
7126,"Perfect home base for your chicago adventures! The closest transit line takes you right into the city and the neighborhood around you has tons of great places to grab a meal, drink, or just explore! I loved this location!"
7126,nice little space near a lively neighborhood.  would stay again.
7126,"Immediately driving into the area I noticed it looked quite nice, lots of cool shops and things to eat. The Airbnb was very cramped, but not too the point of it being uncomfortable, we had two people be very fine it. All the basic amenities were there, things were clean. Sarah was communicative, but we didn't require much communication since we didn't need much from her.

I really liked the location. Felt very safe walking around at night. There was lots of fun stuff to do. Very short Uber to a lot of major Chicago places. If I am in Chicago again, I would stay here for sure. A+"
7126,"Sarahâ€™s place was so welcoming and cozy, and the location was unbeatable. I had a great stay and would come back again."
9811,The reservation was canceled 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9811,"Barbara is an excellent host, very informative, helpful and friendly. The little pug dog Stella is adorable to say the least! The place is neat, clean and cozy with a great location and walking distance to Old Town. At times the street noise can get a little noisy, but usually not for long. Great place!"
9811,"Barb's place was lovely! 
This was my first Airbnb experience and she really set the bar high. 
Everything we needed was there. 
Barb even gave us tips on places to eat in the neighbourhood. 

Also, my first time in Chicago and I found it really easy to navigate the city from here. Great location. "
9811,"Barbara and At Home Inn was extremely helpful and accomodating. The neighborhood was terrific and only a few blocks to the metro that takes you straight downtown. The Hideaway was very clean and everything we could need was provided! The only thing - and maybe it was just me not reading carefully enough beforehand -  is that the second bed is a hide-away bed in the couch and just not very comfortable. We did not realize it was a hide-away until we got there and saw one actual bed. Do not let that deter you from staying here at all, just a heads up. I would stay there again in a heart beat. Thank you again for having us!"
9811,"Very happy with the flat, location, and service from At Home chicago. Cozy place that's near Lincoln park, its zoo, and loads of good restaurants and cafÃ©s."
9811,Great location and spacious one bedroom. Perfect for a visit to Chicago no matter the reason.
9811,"Very nice appartement, clean and well decorated. Kitchen with everything you need for cooking. Excellent location near Lincoln Park, quiet and safe. Perfect stay!"
9811,"Barbaraâ€™s Hideaway in Old Town Chicago was perfect! The host was very helpful. She greeted us warmly when we arrived. She gave us a tour of the apartment and informed us of nearby attractions. We were within walking distant of the Lincoln Park Zoo and Conservatory, which was wonderful! My family and I really enjoyed our stay."
9811,"
Our host Barbara was there to welcome us and was very helpful with any questions we had.  The apartment was very clean and well-appointed.  The location was great for us. There were grocery stores, drug stores, and restaurants within walking distance.  I would certainly rent this apartment again.  Barbara also gave us a wonderful rum cake and when we told her how much we liked it, she gave us another one.  "
9811,"This was a great place to stay right in a great part of Chicago.  My host was great about reaching out to make sure check in was simple, showed me around a bit.  The place was large and really fit my needs, especially since the weather was crummy enough that I spent a lot of time in it working.  Enjoyed crossing the street to grab pizza and beer, walking to the park and to grab a great breakfast at the local hotel.  Plus a fantastic piano!"
9811,"Great location, lovely apartment, wonderful host:). Would happily stay here again. Apartment has everything you need including good storage to completely unpack. Lovely private enclosed patio right out back door. Amazing parks, the Lake and Downtown all within easy walking distance. "
9811,"Checking in was very easy.  Barbara welcomed us at our arrival and told us about everything that we need to know about the place.  She was also very responsive.  We had no control of AC on our floor, and we spent our first night feeling very cold.  After I told Barbara about it the next day, she agreed to reset the temp, and we definitely felt a difference during the following three nights of stay.  Also, she provided us with parking permits, and although it took us sometime to find a spot on the street, we always managed to find parking within very walkable distance.  The place has great decoration and is fairly roomy, and it comes with everything that you will ever need during your stay.  The neighborhood is safe, quite, and convenient with easy access to CVS, restaurants, and park.  I will definitely choose Barbara's place if I ever come back to Chicago! "
9811,Barbara was an excellent host!  The apartment and location were wonderful. Plenty of places to eat and things to do within easy walking.  Lincoln Park very close.  Very comfortable bed and kitchen had all the needed items to prepare meals. Barbara was easy to reach and responded quickly to all questions. Thank you Barbara for a wonderful place to stay!
9811,Walkable to shops/restaurants/the lake in a pretty little area of Chicago
9811,"The photos don't quite do justice to how gorgeous the place is. The apartment appears luxurious, but still felt cozy and comfortable. It was clean and well-stocked, like a hotel room. Barbara was incredibly friendly and kind. There are a number of good eating places, along with a CVS, nearby. Furthermore, the place was conveniently located near a number of bus lines. Definitely worth it. "
9811,"The communication with At Home was very good, easy, and timely.   Barbara, the owner, is the sweetest and most helpful of owners.   My girls and I, loved the apartment and found Barbara fascinating.   

The property itself was wonderful.  It had everything we needed including a washer and dryer.    We made and ate breakfasts in and the kitchen was well stocked with every supply and utensil we needed.  We also enjoyed our time in the morning with our coffees on the very comfortable patio out back.  The bed and the sofa bed were both very comfortable.    

We come to Chicago every summer for a long weekend and always try to find  a place in Lincoln Park.  Barbara's Hideaway was absolutely perfect for us.   It's location cannot be beat.  One block from the bus line, the park, and from the Divvy bikes.  We had a jam backed weekend booked with tickets to Hamilton, and Cubs game and a concert at Soldier field and this place could not be been placed any better.   We could walk easily to many places for dinner or to local shopping and just as easily hop into cab or Uber to go up to the Cubs game or downtown for a show.     

We will definitely be back.   Thank you for making our stay so wonderful.  

Barb, Amy, and Geena"
9811,"Great location, great host. We will stay here again when in Chicago !"
9811,"This was the first time this has ever happened to me- where I booked a place well in advance, get confirmation, arrive in the city and find out at the very last moment possible that I couldn't actually have the place I booked had confirmed!  The host was very apologetic, and offered a different apartment for the same price.... but I didn't have many options at that point and I didn't appreciate being in that position."
9811,Great location. Enjoyed interacting with the landlord. Would stay again!
9811,"Very nice apartment with outdoor patio in a good location.  Very convenient to public transportation and walkable to Lincoln Park, shopping, restaurants, and Second City.  Very responsive host."
9811,Cozy & clean! Very safe location. Thank you!
9811,The location is great.  The beds are super comfortable. Neighborhood restaurants were fun!
9811,Great stay and place to stay for a weekend away! Location is perfect
9811,"Barbara's Hideaway is in an excellent location in Lincoln Park and was a very good value.  It is comfortable and quiet, and even has a washer and dryer in the unit which is a big plus.  We enjoyed her little patio for a relaxing shaded lunch one day.  Barbara is quick to respond to any request and super sweet, too!"
9811,Barbara was a lovely host and her unit is impeccable with great proximity to Downtown and the lake. We will return to Barbaraâ€™s next time weâ€™re in town. Thanks!
9811,.
9811,This place was great. Wonderful location. Easy access to the subway and the city. Right next to the park and easy access to the beautiful bike trail. Barbara was a wonderful host who could any local questions and directed us to some tasty dinners. Would come back to this location in a heartbeat. Old town was a wonderful place to walk around. 
9811,"The apartment is in a GREAT location and is very charming. Barbara is accommodating and friendly. It was a terrific place to stay for my first trip to Chicago. Thank you, Barbara and At Home!"
9811,Barbara was the sweetest quick responder to everything and anything! This hideaway was perfectly sized for comfort to feel right at home! So happy it was in such a safe neighborhood and so close to downtown! Had the best 6 day visit to enjoy the city and Lollapalooza Music Festival! Thank you again for everything Barbara!

9811,"The location was perfect.  However, the room was too cold, and we couldn't control the temperature. Communicating with the host was also little difficult. Other than those, it was overall not bad. "
9811,I loved my stay here! It was in a good neighborhood and not too far from anything I wanted to do! I would definitely stay here again.
9811,"Barbara's Hideaway was ideal for our long weekend. It was tidy, cozy, and equipped with everything we could have needed. The in-unit washer and dryer was ideal after running a soggy Chicago Marathon. Barbara was extremely hospitable and made check in and check out a breeze. And the location can't be beat!"
9811,"Barbara is a gracious host and was easy to communicate with.  The apartment is in a great location and amenities are as advertised.  Those on sofa bed in front room may hear street traffic in morning.  'Garden level' basement apartment shares footprint w/ home mechanical so you'll notice sound of furnace blower when you arrive. But as it's essentially white noise, you may not notice it long, and it does drown out street traffic. Heavy sleeper in our group was fine.  Light sleeper thought front room was noisy.  We would stay there again."
10610,This was the first time I did Airbnb and was a little hesitant. But the setup and everything turned out awesome. Lois was very sweet and considerate. She checked in regularly and made sure we were comfortable. 
10610,"We had a wonderful time at Lois' place. The room is very nice, with beautiful vintage furniture and a comfortable bed. Though the apartment is in an old building and some things are still unrenovated, it is equipped with everything you need, and it comes at a very reasonable price. The location is just perfect in one of Hyde Park's most charming streets, close to UofC campus and very convenient with supermarkets, restaurants and public transportation all in walking distance. As this is a shared four-bedroom condo, we had the opportunity to meet nice people from all parts of the world, which was awesome.
Lois is a great person and a great hostess - she always took care of all our needs and made us feel really welcome, and she makes some excellent southern style chicken :) 
We will definitely come back next time we visit Chicago!



"
10610,"I enjoyed my stay in Lois' apartment. The room and common areas in the apartment are clean. Lois is a very kind host, she is always there for us. If we have questions, we will just text or email her and she will reply. I had some changes in my booking (I have to leave one week earlier) and she was very understanding. Above all, I love the cookies that she gave us. Overall, I would recommend to stay in Lois' place, it feels like home away from home staying there.    "
10610,"Everything was fine, good location. "
10610,Had a great long term stay at Lois's place! She is so friendly and always makes sure that everything is perfect for your stay. Would definitely recommend!!
10610,"Lois was extremely flexible with adjustments that were requested.  She even guided me to the use of the Airbnb system.  The location was great  with availability to public transportation, restaurants, grocery stores and entertainment in a safe environment.  The apartment was a little more vintage than my son expected he was not as appreciative of his accommodations. "
10610,"made a family time of stress less stressful
Tony"
10610,"My experience with Lois, albeit limited, was wonderful. She was very warm and welcoming over the phone and provided great directions on how to get into the place in her absence. In contrast, the condo was very meh, very average. It was shabby, old, dusty, and in desperate need of a face lift. The floors creak, so you can hear everyone walking around, and the walls are paper thin. A bit of a nuisance, when it's a full house (4bd/1ba) as it was when I was there. The shower doesn't drain properly, and the water takes a minute or two to heat up. When I got there, there was no comforter on my bed, only sheets and pillows. I did find a comforter pretty easily in a supply closet, but I'm not sure how clean it was considering there were a lot of long brown hairs on it. The main benefits to the place were that it's very close to a major bus stop and within walking distance to the University of Chicago and other Hyde Park sites. So for my short-term academic purposes, it was fine. If you're just looking for a budget crash pad and a place to store your belongings, then look no further. But if you're looking for something a little extra, this place may not be the best option for you."
10610,"Lois is a very nice person and welcoming host, but the building is old and run down and the rooms are small.  It needs paint and other repairs.  The stairwell was very dirty.  Someone was sleeping on the couch, so there was no place to sit on my last day.   I was locked out of the building because of a broken lock on the front door.  It has a/c and is convenient to the U. of Chicago, and in a nice neighborhood."
10610,"Shortly before my arrival in my host city, my lodging plans changed, and it was no longer prudent to stay in the room I purchased. I did visit the room, which was clean and well stocked with food, toiletries, entertainment, and other amenities. My hosts kept in good contact, and they were kind enough to refund me my cleaning fee and even offered to comp me a night in their room on my next trip there since my plans changed. In general, I found them very pleasant and generous hosts."
10610,I would recommend Lois and Edward's to anyone who wants a convienent affordable place to stay in Chicago.  Lois stayed in communication the entire time until we were in the door.  It is near the CTA and a nice little neighborhood that you could explore.  I plan stay there again in the near future.
10610,"The place was ok. She was nice and neighborhood was beautiful.
The house was very old vintage style. 
I was not expected really clean hotel with that price so it was ok to me but the one thing couldn't stand was smell of bed!! It was like someone pee on the bed.. I couldn't sleep well.. Hopefully she fix this. Other than that you will save money a lot! "
10610,"We were traveling on a tight budget and so Lois' unit made the trip possible.  4 days in Chicago, a 5 min walk from the University is Chicago and restaurants for $50 per day.  Can't beat it on price.  The place was a bit cluttered but had all the basics. Lois has a daily service to replace towels and do some light cleaning.  It's not a high end hotel but for the price we were happy with the experience.   "
10610,Charming old apartment in a nice neighborhood.
10610,"The accommodation was a in a very quiet area close to University campus and close to the lake. Nice old architecture building and interior. If you are looking to meet the host and exchange life/travel experience, something different might be more suitable. Either way, had a good time staying at this place!"
10610,"The place is fine to stay in, although the floors have cracking noise, yet not aweful. "
10610,"I stayed here two weeks to work with a colleague at the University of Chicago. The other bedrooms were also occupied by fun people, making my stay more pleasant (we all went out together a few times) and showing me that a bathroom for six people is not really enough! If community living is not your thing, then this is not the place for you, but if you don't mind interacting with interesting people and pitching in to keep the place clean enough, you will have a great time here."
10610,"This is a decent place for a short-term stay if cost and location are your main concern. Itâ€™s close to the University of Chicago, shopping areas, and public transit, and it was by far the cheapest room in Hyde Park when I checked. It has all the basic amenities (internet, ac, towels etc.) and the absentee owners seemed nice and attentive. That said, the place is kind of rundown, dark, and cluttered, so if that bothers you, you may want to think about other options. "
10610,Great hosts - Close to the University of Chicago which was just what we needed.
10610,"It's an older condo, but it is kept in good repair, and it is furnished very lovingly with nice older furniture, framed art, and such. It is kept clean, in good order, and there are plenty of extra changes of linen to be used as needed."
10610,"Great place to stay. Easy parking, even with all the University people near by. Walls are rather thin between rooms, but it shouldn't be much of a problem as long as one is quiet and other people there also understand that the walls are thin. Great place for the price, and great hosts that far exceed the price expectations. "
10610,Great spot
10610,"Great location, hosts are very nice and responsive."
10610,"The hosts were awesome! They made us a delicious dinner with a great talk, they really made us feel like home. Great place and great location! Definitely will come back!!"
10610,"As a visiting student at U Chicago for the summer quarter, I find this place an excellent choice. It is less than a 15-minute-walking distance to the library. Lois is caring and most of the time easy to reach. The house is a bit old, but most apparatuses function. The only uncontrollable factor is the roommates because the house is not well soundproofed. Luckily most of the time people respect one another. In general, I had a perfect time here.

By the way, currently, HBO is subscribed. The TV is small, but good enough for every Sunday night after doing piles of homework and having resented for not spending the time at bars instead."
10610,"Lois and Ed are great hosts, very friendly and extremely accommodating. My husband is an Android developer and he works on building apps for TVs. We only inquired about what kind of a TV is in the apartment and Lois offered to bring in a flat screen to support my husband's work, that just made it the best thing for us. 
The apartment location is great, the room we had is very spacious and the AC comes handy in the Summers. Definitely one of the best hosts I know of."
10610,I lived at Lois and Ed's place for 3 months for an internship and it was conveniently located close to University of Chicago so I did not have to have any headache of driving. Lois was very attentive to my needs and was easy to communicate with. It was a great place to spend my 3 months in Chicago. I would definitely go back when I come back to Chicago.
10610,"Lois and Ed were very nice in helping me out at the last minute! This place is quite close to University of Chicago medical center where I was rotating; made my short time there much easier. The neighborhood is quite pretty too. Target is just a couple of minutes away on foot, which is always a plus."
10610,"I wasn't much in the place, but it was close to campus and had a nice bed."
10610,"Would recommend staying here! Great location, great accommodations. I just needed a bed to sleep in and a shower and both of these needs were met! Very happy."
10610,"This is a lovely community house, everyone was friendly but still allowed you to keep to yourself. Beautiful, easy access to public transportation if you need to go to downtown. I would definitely stay here again!"
10610,"Stayed for almost 4 months.  Nice, beautiful and quiet neighborhood, close to public transport and walking distance to University of Chicago. Lois is very helpful in whatever is needed. The place is great, old style, with nice common spaces and the room is perfect.  Definitely recommend staying here."
10610,"Perfect location for those who have activities at Chicago University. 
The condo is old, as described, but has the basics, all that is absolutely necessary for a short stay."
10610,"Since this was my first time using AirB&B I was excited!  I was very disappointed!  Two good things though, my roommates were very nice and the location was great!!"
10610,"I had a wonderful weekend getaway, definitely felt like a home away from home. You can not beat the value of this space!!"
10945,"I stayed at the Biddle 1 for a few days, and the place was exactly what I was looking for. Nice neighborhood, a bloc from the metro and very easy access; the apartment itself had some old charm, nicely decorated, and the host was so easy to deal with it was perfect. "
10945,"The host was really professional and helpful. Can't beat the location! Close to Old Town, restaurants, stores, and the Lincoln Park Zoo. "
10945,The place is in an excellent location.  Not one thing I'd change about it.  We will definitely be staying here again.  
10945,Would definitely stay here again. Great location. Key codes for the doors were very convenient
10945,Loved staying with At Home Inn! The space was clean and cute! I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others!! Perfect location as well
10945,I appreciated the location of the residence which was located next to public transit and close to the restaurants and shops in Old Town.  The neighborhood was walkable and quiet.  Everything went well with check in and was as expected.
10945,"Our group had a wonderful stay at the Biddle House. The home was clean, spacious, and very comfortable for our group of 4. The keyless entry was super convenient and the location is perfect. Right next to the L, and walking distance from some great bars, restaurants, and night life, like The Second City. Elizabeth was a great host and accommodated our late checkout. Weâ€™d love to stay at The Biddle House again! "
10945,"We had a nice stay at Biddle House #1. The check-in process was very convenient, the place was clean, and the location was perfect. Air conditioning was nice especially in the summer. "
10945,Great location!
12068,"Dominic was very responsive and arranged for me to move in the apartment couple hours after I made a request. The apartment is well equiped, with a living room, a kitchen and a bedroom. The bed was confortable and the kitchen perfect to cook. Dominic arranged for every requests and problem that happened (find a place to park my bike, improve the internet, fix the shower that was misfunctioning...). 

In terms of location, it is right by the red line (really 5 seconds away). And I recommend the thai place accross the street!"
12068,"I had a really good first Airbnb experience with Dominic! He contacted me a few days before arriving to the apartment and sent all the instructions to make sure I knew what to do when getting to the place. 
The location of the apartment is AMAZING. It's within the limits of Old Town and Gold Coast. Two beautiful neighborhoods in Chicago. It's a few blocks away from Lake Michigan, Lincoln Park Zoo and super close to Michigan Av. aka The Magnificent Mile. 
Right at the door you can access the Red Line train which works 24/7 and you have access to supermarkets, restaurants and stores close by.
Even though Dominic himself wasn't there to greet me he was always available by mail or phone and was willing to help solve any issues or questions that may have arisen, even after my stay! 
The apartment itself is very spacious and had everything I needed during my stay (if not more); coffee maker, microwave oven, modern kitchen with all the appliances, vacuum cleaner, iron and even a blowdryer. Even though it's a one bedroom apartment it's all connected, so you don't have doors separating the living room from the bedroom or kitchen. That was not a problem for me at all, though. 
There's a small fitness center in the condominium in case you need  it, as well as a laundry room for you to use. I didn't need to use it because clean sheets were provided by the host as well as towels. 
If you send packages to the apartment you should know there's not a doorman available 24/7, so the packages you receive are left in the front or back door and then put in a common room. I was a bit skeptical about this, however the two packages I had delivered were there waiting for me when I got back at the end of the day.  
 "
12068,"My stay with Dominic was overall a great experience. While I never met him in person, check-in was easy and all other communications were very pleasant. The location for this space is great! You literally walk right out the door to the Clark/Division metro stop. The location is also great because you are walking distance to several grocery stores, pharmacies, and fun Wells Street where I found any type of restaurant you could possibly imagine. 

The space was perfect for what I needed. I was in town for work and I after a long day, I needed a place to unwind and relax. There were a few problems upon move in (broken light bulb and electrical outlet, tv with screen issues), that Dominic arranged to have fixed by the building manager very quickly. There were a lot of little ""extras"" that I really enjoyed: plenty of towels, extra sheets, some cleaning supplies, extra pillows, kitchen essentials, etc.) The building was very safe and clean.

I would absolutely recommend this place for someone else and would happily return here to my next visit to Chicago. "
12068,"I loved staying at Dominic's studio in the Old Town / Gold Coast area. It's plenty of space for one person and definitely enough for two. I would say that the pictures in the listing are representative of the space. The studio is very well divided and includes a large living room, kitchen and bedroom. The bathroom is small, but I never found it to be an issue. There is an AC unit in the bedroom for those hotter summer days and I never had to use it (I was only there for three months in the summer), but there are also heating units that run along the wall of each of the three ""rooms.""

Dominic has the apartment professionally cleaned between each stay and there are plenty of clean towels, blankets, pillows, etc. He is also friends with the building manager who quickly takes care of any handy work that may need to be done around the apartment. The building also includes a small laundry room on the ground level that was very convenient and a mail and package room if you're planning on a longer stay (just be sure to add your name to the mailbox).

The apartment building is located just outside the Clark/Division red line stop. Additionally, it almost shares a parking lot with a Jewel (grocery store; 30 sec walk) and is just a couple minutes away from a 24-hour CVS (pharmacy/convenience store; 2 min walk); the newly opened Halal Guys (late-night Greek food; 5 min walk); and my personal late-night favorite, Velvet Taco (Texan-style tacos; 10 min walk).

I'm so happy I was able to stay at Dominic's and I will definitely be back again if I ever get the chance. "
12068,"I felt comfortable at Dominic's place the second I walked in. I just finished a long-term stay and had a tough time leaving. The apartment is very well-appointed, it's located in a great area and Dominic was very responsive whenever we had to connect about something. The apartment has everything you would ever need or want to be comfortable and I was happy to be able to call it home for an extended period of time. 

On top of Dominic, the building manager (Al) was also very friendly and good to get to know. He was always there to help with anything.  I'm very thankful for the place to stay and would certainly recommend it to people who prefer a comfortable apartment over a small hotel room....especially for an extended amount of time. 

Old Town shops are a block away. Gold Coast restaurants are within a few blocks and the lake is a 5+ min walk. Division/Clark red line stop is right at the base of the building too. Can't beat the location. "
12068,"Dominic did a great job making the place look good and leaving extra amenities such as towels, blankets, fans, hangers, etc.  The AC was not very strong throughout the whole unit. The red line right outside the building was very convenient and the location was good but some sketchy people around (you'll probably get that anywhere in Chicago though). Overall really easy and good stay just pricey. "
12068,Amazing apartment. Gorgeous. Clean. Has everything you'd need for a long stay. And Dominic is a wonderful host. He's always available to answer my questions and fix things. I have 0 complains.
12068,"Great location, great place! Dominic was great and very quick at getting back to me!"
12068,"The condo was a perfect stay for my first year in Chicago! The location was central, easy access to public transportation, grocery stores, and yummy restaurants. The place was clean, and stocked with linens, cooking pots and pans, and cleaning supplies. Dominic, the host, was very responsive to all of my messages, and fufilled my request for any additionals needs. I HIGHLY suggest staying here, anytime all year long!"
12140,"My wife and I spent our 5th year anniversary at the Lincoln Park Guest House. Lincoln Park is a beautiful and aesthetically pleasing neighborhood with much to do, and the Guest House is right in the heart of it all. It's location is perfect for accessing the Chicago nightlife and there are plenty of options for daytime excursions nearby. The room was extremely comfortable with lots of sunlight and a high cathedral ceiling. The room afforded us plenty of privacy as well. Sharon took great care of us, was very flexible and such a genuine host. She even let me play her beautiful Steinway piano! If you are looking for comfort, ease and a great location, this is one great place."
12140,"This was the ideal place for us in the heart of Lincoln Park.  The private room on the second floor all by itself was extremely large with vaulted ceilings, natural light/windows, a high quality tv, wireless internet, and an adjoining bathroom.  The furnishings and bedding were superior.  There was a mini-frig, lots of clothes hangers, luggage stands, and all the extras you need -- hair dryer, iron/board, water, Keurig, and snacks.  Though on a busy street, the inside was very quiet, and exceeded our expectations.  Sharon was a great host and was able to accommodate our early arrival.  I will definitely come back as it is such a wonderful place to stay.

Leo
"
12140,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Lincoln Park Guest House. Sharon was incredibly hospitable. Nice thoughtful touches throughout and really gave us great local recommendations. Great location, walking distance to parks, shops and restaurants with a neighborhood feel without the hustle of downtown.  Also- the bed was so incredibly comfortable! If I'm ever in Chicago again, i hope to stay at Lincoln Park Guest House."
12140,"A fantastic spot with great comfort, hosts and a super location! I will stay here next time as well!"
22362,"My business partner and I had the pleasure of staying at Craig's 2 bedroom condo for 6 weeks.  The condo is very clean, modern and very very cozy with all the amenities of home and more.  Craig puts much TLC into his home for renters to enjoy.  You will be delighted with the neighborhood and all it's little treasures and being close to many of Chicago's popular areas.  We had a blast and at the end of the work dayâ€¦ coming home to such a relaxing environment was a blessing!  I can't wait to book our stay in Spring.  Craig you were so easy and accommodating to work with!  We are very grateful for such a positive experience.  If your in Chicago and want the perfect place to call homeâ€¦ Get in touch with Craig!  :)"
22362,A comfy place to call home when visiting Chicago. Easy access to downtown via the Blueline or #66 bus. Craig was available to take care of questions and issues with the fridge and parking that arose. 2 separate bedrooms gave us maximum privacy for teen and adults. All in all a great stay!
22362,Craig's home was very spacious and comfortable and extremely well-located. I loved being able to indulge in the large jacuzzi and then watch some OnDemand on the large TV's in each bedroom! I highly recommend this place.
22362,"We loved the apartment. It was convenient to downtown and had a parking place.
To quote my wife "" if we visit Chicago again we would stay at Craig's place""."
22362,"We had a wonderful time staying at Craig's place, and he was a great host. The apartment worked out perfectly for our family--I stayed there with my husband and my 2 boys, ages 4 and 1. There was plenty of room for the kids to share the 2nd bedroom (with the 1 year old in our pack-n-play), and also lots of room for the kids to spread out with their toys in the main living space. As a bonus there really wasn't anything on low shelving that we had to watch out for around them...I think I only moved 2 items to a higher spot on the mantle the entire time! We never saw nor heard any of the neighbors, the parking spot was super convenient (not to mention the frequently available free street parking), and the location was great. We were able to visit various other neighborhoods and downtown easily, and also enjoyed exploring West Town and Ukrainian Village (Pie Eyed Pizza, Greek Corner, and Star Lounge Coffee Bar are all recommended). 

As a host, Craig was easy to communicate with and very hospitable. He responded to all of my questions, and when I needed to amend my trip reservation he helped make the process quick and painless. "
22362,Nice spacious and clean apartment very close to downtown and 45mn from O'Hare on the Blue Line. The area boasts several nice restaurants and bars within short walking distance. We didn't get to meet Craig but he has been very responsive and helpful before and throughout our stay. Great Airbnb experience overall.
22362,"My family and I stayed at Craig's place for 5 weeks this summer. The condo was very clean and very spacious. We have two young boys, and there was plenty of room for them to spread out and play. We also enjoyed taking them to the park that's just across the street. The neighborhood provided a variety of restaurants, bars and shops all within walking distance. And with a bus stop right in front of the condo and a blue line stop within a 5-10 minute walk, we never had to drive.

Craig was very easy to communicate with and very willing to help out in any way he could. We would definitely recommend staying here."
22362,"Craig's condo was perfect for our family. We enjoyed the large living space where we could all be together. We ate dinner on the balcony. Beds and couch were comfortable. The building is in a nice quiet area of West Town. Public transportation was close by and downtown was easily accessible by bus or train. We also enjoyed the neighborhood restaurants, bars and coffee shop. It was great! Thanks Craig"
22362,"We rented Craig's apt for 6 weeks. Craig was very hospitable, quick to respond and the apt is well equipped (altho more lamps would be nice). The unit came as described: a large, open floorplan apt with high ceilings and much natural light. The porch/balcony with Weber grill was a great plus too.
The beauty of the location was that the #66 CTA bus stopped right in front of the apt., plus the Blue line ""El"" was a 5 minute walk; so getting around Chicago was very quick, inexpensive and convenient ($105 pass for one month). The location of the apt is in the West Town/Noble Square neighborhood. It is slowly getting ""gentrified"". We felt safe walking around, although, like being in any big city, one should be aware of your surroundings. There are at least 5 good restaurants within a 5 minute walk (bars too) and there is a nice park (Eckhardt) directly across the street for walking or watching softball games, etc.. Being from the quiet suburbs, we had to get used to city & apt. noises; and we did that quickly, never becoming real issues. 
We always had 2 cars there; and altho there is reserved parking for 2 with the apt., it is one behind the other and quite tight, requiring multiple adjustments. So we parked one car on meter-free Elizabeth St., and never had problems finding a spot nearby (just don't leave anything visible in the car).
All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Craig's apt and our stay in Chicago. We would definitely stay at Craig's again."
22651,Great spot in Wrigleyville! Good for a group and would stay there again for sure.  
22651,The host canceled my reservation.
22651,"We had a most relaxing time in Joanne house.  The house is very confortable and beautifully located.  The only thing I would add is an electric kettle, that's all.
Will be back there for our next visit in Chicago."
22651,Joanne and Steve were amazing at accommodating me and my boyfriend at a very short notice. Their place in Wrigleyville was walking distance to everything we wanted plus right next to the red line to take into downtown. It is very cozy and clean. Thanks for helping me give my boyfriend a great weekend in Chicago!
22651,"The location was fantastic and right around the corner from major bus lines and the Addison Red Line Station.  We had a large group of seven students, and we shared the space incredibly well.  We weren't on top of each other, and we hosted a really nice dinner party for ten people.  The kitchen has plenty of cooking supplies.  The price is fantastic given the enormous size of the apt. - perfect for a family or large group.  The only downsides were hard/uncomfortable mattresses, and low water pressure in the shower (but it was hot!).  However, for the overall price, location, and quality of the apt., it was a great deal.  I would definitely stay with Joanne and Steve again. "
22651,"Please note that this is a 3rd floor walk-up apartment. That wasn't readily apparent to me from the description. I had a difficult time reaching the owners in advance to ask a couple of questions. However, once we were there they were prompt and responsive. A couple of things weren't working, but they took care of them within 24 hours. The place was generally nice and comfortable, although there were a few areas (living room windows) that clearly need fixing/updating. All in all a successful stay."
22651,"Never change a winning team. It's been the second time for us to stay at JoAnne's and Steve's places and I will probably try to stay there in all the years to come. We almost instantaneously felt at home once we arrived at their places. 
JoAnne and Steve took very good care of everything and replied to all questions in almost no time.

Their place at W Waveland Ave is right in the middle of everything - just a stone throw from Wrigley Field with lots of pubs and restaurant around the corner.

So, yeah, why change anything that works perfect? Hopefully we will have the opportunity to meet them during our  stay next year!"
22651,"Fabulous place - could not say enough good things. Great location - 3 min walk to El train station and the view of Wrigley field from the kitchen window is great. The pictures do not do this place justice - much larger than it appears on the site. Joanne & Steve were fabulous - we sent a message asking if the heat could be turned on and they were over same day.

After this stay my group has all agreed we will never go back to Hotels/Hostels again!"
22651,"This was my first AirBnB experience so I was not sure what to expect.  Owners were very responsive via email and flexible about meeting up on first day for check in.  The place was clean and nicely appointed.  The apartment was classic vintage Chicago and everything worked.  Beds were comfy and sheets, towels, etc were all available.  They even had a hair dryer and coffee maker.  honestly, I dont think I'd stay at a hotel again with places like this available at comparable prices.  I had a very good experience with AirBnB and this host. "
22651,JoAnne was an excellent host.  She met us at the apartment and gave us the keys and a run through.  She was also able to make sure we had places to park our two cars for the weekend which was fantastic.  The apartment was perfect for what we needed and provided plenty of space for the 6 of us who stayed.  After our great experience we would never stay in a hotel again!  The apartment was close to everything we needed and the neighborhood was great.
22651,Beautiful condo! Nicely furnished and in a nice neighborhood. The grocery store was only a few blocks away and the condo was located in a lovely neighborhood. We really enjoyed our visit and would definitely stay here again.
22651,"Fantastic apartment, wonderful location.  I highly recommend staying here and Steve & JoAnne were very friendly and helpful.  I'll never stay in a hotel or downtown when I visit Chiago again!"
22651,"This place suited our needs perfectly.  I was celebrating a birthday and needed a place to house a total of seven people and three dogs.  Joanne was very responsive and left keys for us outside building to get in.  We never met her in person at all yet felt she was very helpful.  The house is fully furnished so I felt as though I was at home.  The beds were comfortable, TV was working (included cable and on demand stuff), kitchen was fully stocked with utensils, cups, plates, etc.  There was coffeee, tea, and working microwave, stove, etc  The kitchen space was my favorite space.  We even brought our own food and the refrigerator was big enough to fit everything- including our drinks.  This is apartment #2 so you do have to go up three flights of stairs but it's not so bad.  No elevator though. The only downside I can think of was that there was only one bathroom so that was tough for 7 people.  Also, there is parking available but it is somewhat inconvenient because street parking is hard to find and available for free only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. unless you have a residential parking permit.  That made parking after 6 p.m. very difficult so we had to find metered parking which is free after 9 p.m. until 8 a.m.   Also metered parking usually has a limit of two hours so we had to move our car at least once from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  We also had to park our car in an overnight lot since when we got back from our evening out (around 3 a.m.), there were no metered parking.  So we paid $15 to park overnight- still cheaper than at a hotel but an inconvenience nevertheless.   Joanne was helpful in trying to locate some free parking spots for us other nearby units but we didn't want to have to park too far from our apt.  The apt is one block off North Clark street which is the street Wrigleyfield is on so there are plenty of pubs/restaurants to check out.  We were able to walk 1.5 blocks to Salt and Pepper Diner for brunch- a small place but yummy food.  We were also able to work in a late check out itme of 3 p.m.  Check-in time was very flexible as well.  There were plenty of residential streets to walk our dogs although seems like no one in that neighborhood picks up their dog poo so watch out for dog poo- at least three of us stepped on dog poo.  It is a bit noisy being close to main street but not intrusive at all- it's just normal city noises."
22651,Steve and Joanne - thank you very much for your hospitality during our stay in Chicago. The accomodations were very good and offered the space needed by our large family - we were very comfortable there!
22651,WE LOVED STEVE AND JOANNE's place!! :) There ended up being 5 of us instead of 7 but it was more than big enough for all of us. The ONLY problem was that there was no parking for my out of town guests. The other people in the building were in the garage so i had to find parking for my friends the whole weekend which can be hard when the area is permit only. Will definitly rent through them again and you cannot beat the price of an entire convo vs. a tiny hotel room! :) 
22651,"JoAnne is a great host, her flat was impecably clean and well-kept, she was available for us by phone anytime we needed. A great experience !"
22651,"Whenever I travel to Chicago it is for business reasons. Lots of work and long days. Therefore it is very important for me to have a place that is absolutely suitable for my needs. A couple of years ago I came across JoAnnes' and Jasons' temp homes. And that was the beginning of a great relationship. They offer everything you expect from a great host. 
Their place are well located, clean and comfortable. You just get what you need. JoAnne is absolutely reliable and highly responsive. For me it is a sure thing that my Chicago host are and will be J&J!
"
22651,"This condo is in the perfect location, especially if you are attending a Cubs game as Wrigley is right around the corner! There are lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance and an ""L"" stop a couple of streets over. The backyard is perfect for having local friends for a visit and a barbecue.

JoAnne and Jason were super accommodating with our earlier-than-expected arrival and it set the tone for a great weekend!

We will definitely look at this place again when we come back to Chicago! "
22651,Right by Wrigley Field!  Great location with plenty of space and comfortable beds. Loved it!
22651,"We really liked the cleanliness, size, and location  of the apartment. The place is right next to Wrigley field and nightlife on Clark st. JoAnne was helpful and communicated everything with us very well. We enjoyed the flexible check in and check out times. We recommend this to anyone with a group of 6 - 8 people. "
22651,Extremely comfortable and our hosts were fantastic. Excellent neighborhood and very convenient. Much better than a hotel!
22651,"Beautiful house, very clean on arrival. House is located right next to Wrigley Field and around the corner from the train. Any questions or problems we had were addressed promptly, awesome couple to work with. Thanks JoAnne and Jason for making our stay wonderful."
22651,My family had an excellent experience.  JoAnne made everything easy and comfortable for us.  Location is absolutely awesome!  Can't wait til' our next visit and we'll most definitely check with JoAnne first before making any arrangments.  Thanks again JoAnne!
22651,"Six urban planning grad students, in town for a conference. Overall our experience in this apartment was decent. Please see below to hear what we did and didn't like about this apartment. 
PROS
-Location: My group was attending a conference in downtown Chicago, and it was a quick and easy 20 min ride. 
-Price: With a group of six, we were able to find affordable accommodations for a bunch of broke grad students :)
-Beautiful Apartment: Nice wood floors and kitchen, Decently -comfortable beds, feels very homey. 
-Flexible Check-in/Check-out: Definitely a plus! 
CONS
-Poor communication: we arrived 15 mins early, and I had to call and text Joann several times in before you responded . Also, the front key to the door was missing, and Joann said she would drop it off, which never followed through on. We had to go in and out of the back alley entrance (it's fairly dark back there at night) the entire stay. This was very frustrating. 
-Water pressure: Water pressure in the bathroom is really poor. 
-Loud on the street: the folks in the front bedroom had trouble sleeping because of noise on the street. You have to consider the fact that this apartment is right next to Wrigley field, which means a concentration of loud drunk people whenever there's a game. 
Back bedroom gets cold: The folks in the back bedroom, which appears to have been a sunroom at one time, got pretty cold at night. Our stay was in April, so I would definitely consider that. 
-Towels: Although lots of towels are provided, we found unidentifiable stains on at least half of the ""clean"" ones, which was off-putting. 
-Wrigleyville vibe: This was mostly our fault for not doing more research before we chose a location. We kept referring to the neighborhood at ""Bro-ville,"" because it definitely has a jock/sports  vibe that we weren't expecting. The bars are all sports-related, and the food is all pub food. We were looking for a neighborhood with a little more character, and a more diverse food/bar scene."
22651,"We had a fabulous stay.  The apartment is lovely, spacious, and the layout allows everyone to have some privacy. We will definitely consider renting this property again for our next Chicago visit."
22651,Your lovely home was perfect for our family's stay in Chicago. Thank you so much for all your help.
22651,This place was exactly what we were looking for. It is a no frills type of place in a great neighborhood and just across the street from the stadium. JoAnne was great to work with: she was very responsive to questions and flexible with check-in and out times. I would highly recommend this place and would stay again if I come back to Chicago.
22651,"I had to find a place to stay in the area day-of and JoAnne was incredibly accommodating. The apartment was beautiful and in a perfect location - just off of the bustling Clark St nightlife and only a block from Wrigley Field, and a 10 minute (or less) walk from the Addison L line, but on a very quiet street when you are looking for peace and quiet. JoAnne was very easy to get in touch with and made it very easy, especially given how late I booked the apartment.  This apartment would be great for virtually any group who might want to stay, any age would feel comfortable in the accommodations and it is a great spot for anyone, whether staying for business or pleasure! Will definitely stay with JoAnne again if possible, much better than any hotel if you're looking for the Lakeview/Wrigleyville area!"
22651,"We stayed with our three girls at this fun place on Waveland. It's in a terrific location for North Side devotees and we took advantage of the many restaurants and shops within walking distance. The apartment is vintage with few updates amenities, but it's a good place to stay particularly if you're using it as a launching pad for exploring Chicago. It was clean, and had plenty of room for us. We rented the garage space too. If you have a car, and you're there during baseball season, I highly recommend garage rental. Thanks JoAnne for a great place!"
22651,"Great location & easy entry.

Everything was clean prepared.

Great for cubs games."
22651,"The place was exactly as advertised and exactly what we wanted.  Comfortably slept all seven of us in an apartment that we swear was decorated specifically for us.  Everything was clean and in good condition.  Check in and out was easy and JoAnne is uper responsive on any questions.

Only a block and a half from Wrigley is a huge plus for us.  The Red Line is just on the other side of Wrigley too.

My daughter and I walked four blocks to the grocery and we made a big breakfast for us to eat in the spacious dining room.  It was a nice end to our stay to sit with our family and share the events of the trip.

We go to Wrigley every year and I truly believe this will be the only place we will stay!"
22651,"We were very pleased with this apt!  The location was great and it was wonderful to have garage parking.  The apt was very clean and spacious.  We stayed on nights that were not ""home game"" or weekend nights so the neighborhood was quiet.  This location was very convenient for visiting North-end neighborhoods and for getting into the downtown area."
22651,"The apartment was very nice and was indeed well furnished. 

However, we had many issues with JoAnne. To begin with, when we first arrived at the apartment, we couldnâ€™t get into the building. The code worked to open the exterior door but then there was an interior door that was locked. We called JoAnne multiple times and received no answer. After waiting for almost half an hour we managed to get into the back door. 

When we went up to Apt 1, we found it occupied! After more unanswered calls, we finally got hold of JoAnne and she said her only idea about what happened was that they must have been booked in #2, but gone into #1 by mistake. We were told that #2 was exactly the same and asked if we would be willing to just swap places and stay there instead. We were more than accommodating and said this was no problem at all. 

When we got into #2, it was absolutely freezing and we discovered we had no control over the radiators and that the thermostat must be in another apartment. As we walked through the apartment we saw that in one of the bedrooms there was a HUGE hole in the window. It had been covered in plastic that was no longer even attached to the window. I was able to literally stick my hand out the window. Cold air was blowing into the room. 
 
When we called JoAnne to tell her about the window, and the lack of heat, she told us that if we didn't like the apartment we could quote ""pack our stuff and go somewhere else."" She also said we were only paying $195/night so what more did we want from her? Well, not only was this incredibly rude, but how in the world would we have gone to another place? We had friends who flew in from all over the country and we made our reservation 2 months ago! Additionally, we did not pay $195/night, we paid $295/night, once you included the charges for each additional person over 3 people. We decided we would just stuff something in the window and try to deal with it, because what choice did we really have? 

On top of all this, we had discussed renting a parking spot in the garage. We were told the garage door would be open and we could just park our cars and pay when we got there. Well, the garage door was locked. When we told JoAnne this her response was, â€œwell itâ€™s not supposed to be.â€ That may be, but it is so what do we do? We ended up parking on the street.

Needless to say, we were incredibly frustrated by this entire exchange. I did not feel JoAnne was either friendly or even professional toward us at all. The apartment was nice, and conveniently located, but I do not think it is worth it to have to deal with this woman. "
22651,"This is at least the 4th time I have rented from JoAnne & she continues to deliver beautiful, clean apartments w/ fantastic service.  I highly recommend her properties to anyone looking for a great place to stay in the Chicago area.  Thanks again JoAnne!"
22651,"The apartment was just as promised.   There were six of us for the weekend and we had a great time in the city and in Wrigley.  JoAnne was quick to respond to questions.  
"
22651,"Great size, great location! We had a large group come and stay for New Years Eve and this place held everyone very comfortably. Everyone had a bed! This apartment was in a great location for walking as well. There are tons of bars and restaurant all around and it is a quick walk to catch the train and hit up other parts of the city. I recommend paying the extra $20 to park in the garage if you are bringing a car because parking in the neighborhood is tough and that allows you to come and go as you please. JoAnne was a lovely host and quick to reply if we needed anything. "
22651,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
22651,"The apartment is beautiful. There were six of us staying for three days. The apartment has great light and plenty of space. The neighborhood has grocery stores, restaurants, bars, shopping, train stations, everything you could need. The apt has wireless so I was able to get some work done while on the trip. JoAnne was a great host. We arrived early and were able to stash our bags until check in. She was lovely and accommodating. "
22651,Joanne is an excellent host.  She came over immediately when I needed her - and took care of the situation (contractors working on the bldg. next door were blocking our access to the apt) quickly and professionally.  She is very friendly and interested in providing a quality experience for her guests.
22651,"I first contacted JoAnne regarding one of her properties in the Belmont area, which ended up being already taken, but she was kind enough to offer a larger apartment in Wrigleyville at the exact same price (a considerable discount). The place more than accommodated my party of seven, had reliable internet, was walking distance to great restaurants, attractions, and the CTA red line. The apartment itself was clean, well furnished, and had a home-y vibe. I never met JoAnne personally, but she was very professional and prompt in all of our communications, replying to all of the messages I sent through AirBnB in a few hours or less. I would definitely recommend JoAnne and her properties to anyone interested in visiting Chicago on a budget."
22651,"This place was really nice!!!  Right within walking distance to all kinds of awesome restaurants and bars!  Also close enough to Wrigley.  We loved the ease of check in and the flexibility/accomodation of JoAnne.  
We would definitely stay again.  "
22651,"I came to Chicago with a group of friends from my birthday.  There were 5 of us total, and this apartment was perfect for us.  There was tons of space and enough beds for each of us to sleep comfortably.  The location was ideal, within walking distance of bars and restaurants.  And as Cubs fans, we were thrilled to be literally around the corners from Wrigley Field.  Joanne was very quick to respond when we made the reservation, and her instructions to gain access to the apartment were perfect.  Zero complaints here."
22651,perfect as always. We stayed at this place several times and it's been perfect for us. Right in the middle of lovely Wrigleyville with all its vibrant scene. Driving downtown by car is a matter of 20 minutes. JoAnne is a great friendly and care taking host. 
22651,"We had a wonderful stay at JoAnne's apartment. We were in town for a Cubs game and we were literally around the corner from the stadium. So convenient! Despite being so close to the stadium and so many neighborhood bars, the apartment itself was very quiet. Finding parking was quiet difficult so I'm glad we rented the garage during our stay. JoAnne also accommodated our early check in which was so helpful. The apartment was clean and nicely furnished. I would definitely recommend this apartment to others looking for a place to stay in Wrigleyville. "
22651,JoAnne was very responsive and accommodating. The house worked out perfect for our group! The house looks exactly like it does in the pictures.
22651,"Joanne was a great host! She was very available to 
communicate regarding questions and her place was excellent. I enjoyed dealing with Joanne and loved her place!"
22651,"Great location next to Wrigley - perfect for a guy's baseball weekend.  Simple, plenty of beds, nice outdoor area to hang out.  Was not the cleanest place but it was fine for us."
22651,"JoAnne was a great host -- very responsive and helpful. And the apartment itself was good for my needs...plenty of space and proximal to Wrigley. Only complaint is that the unit could be a bit cleaner, particularly the bathroom -- the shower curtain smelled terribly of mildew. "
22651,"We had a lovely stay in this rental as it very comfortably fit our group of 7. The location was great - just 2 blocks from Wrigley Field and close to the El, but not too loud in the evenings. 

There were items lacking in the kitchen (no pan to make scrambled eggs or pancakes - but plenty of woks and pots) and many of the dishes in the cabinets had to be rewashed. Otherwise, the apartment was clean and well organized. "
22651,Great experience ! Thanks it was really clutch and a great neighborhood .
22651,The location was great - right next to Wrigley Field and a Divy station!
22651,"Neighborhood was perfect -1 block from Wrigley!  Perfect location -the 4 of us had plenty of room, could have had 7 comfortably if needed.  JoAnne was awesome, very accommodating and communicated quickly with my questions.  Home is well taken care of and can't wait to come back next year.
"
22651,"Booking this place was very easy as JoAnne was very responsive to the messages I sent. Overall, the house was great. It was able to accommodate several guest and the location was amazing for going out in Wrigleyville. I really enjoyed the outdoor space with the grill.  "
22651,"Location was great for our needs (going to Cubs games and shopping in the city).

The place is quite large and well furnished.

JoAnne was very helpful in getting us parking permits for street parking and  the flexible check-in/check-out was a much appreciated bonus.

"
22651,Contact with the host was quick and accommodating. the place was as described and you could not get any closer to Wrigley than this!! would be using this host  again when staying in Chicago!!
22651,One word to describe this home and that word is AWESOME! Walked in and was amazed. Went to see the Dodgers play against the Cubs at Wrigley Field and it was literally a block away. My friends and I would definitely rent the house again. Thank you for making my first Chicago experience great!  
22651,"JoAnne And Steve were both easy to get in touch with. They were flexible on the check-in and checkout times and we were able to rent a parking space from them as well which was handy. This apt fit 7 people comfortably. Kitchen was fairly well setup, the dishwasher was nice to have! The location is great, close enough to N. Clark St to hop on a bus or walk to any one of many nearby eateries etc, but still quiet. I would definitely stay here again."
22651,We had a wonderful stay at Steve and JoAnne's well-furnished urban apartment. I think the few negative reviews we saw must just be people who are not accustomed to city living in older buildings. We are three couples in our 30's and 40's and had a lovely time during our college reunion weekend. JoAnne and Steve were extremely responsive and accommodating hosts. Highly recommended!!
22651,We had a great time! It was so smooth and easy working with Steve and Joanne! The place was very nice and worked great for our group.
22651,I have had the good fortune of staying at JoAnne's properties on at least a hand full of occassions.  She time after time delivers with wonderful rentals in the Chicago area.  I highly recommend her for your retreat in Chicago.  She is extremely easy to get a hold of & is an absolute pleasure to work with.  Thank you JoAnne!!!
22651,The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
22651,I had a great time! Once we figured out the parking everything was perfect.
22651,"Nice apartment in a great location! A lot of well furnished space.
Steve and JoAnne were easy to communicate with and very responsive."
22651,The apartment was very good. Lot of room. Could have stacked some extra towels. 
22651,"The condo is clean and comfortable. The hosts are easy to communicate with. It's a nice large space, great for many types of gatherings! The Wrigleyville neighborhood offers lots of access to dining, shopping, public transit and nightlife. It's just  steps to the ballpark too of course!  You need to bring your own coffee and toiletries (soap is provided). There are no ""free extras"" that you usually find in a hotel or other BnBs. However,  there are grocery stores  about a ten minute walk from the place. Street parking and parking passes are available. However during a Cubs home game time, take the garage option if available, as the neighborhood spots fill up quickly on game days! 
"
22651,"A perfectly located property (especially if you're catching a Cubs game!)   with great bars, restaurants and amenities nearby.   We'll equipped apartment with plenty of space and good sized rooms. 

JoAnne was a great host and made it very straightforward for us. 

Thanks again."
22651,"Great place.  Surprisingly huge!  Awesome vintage apartment with vintage furniture.  Really feels like a piece of Chicago history.  Updated bathroom.  Steps from Wrigley.  We ended up scoring tickets and the location was perfect.  Check in and out effortless.  Good price.  A little rough around the edges as any apartment with character has, but I  enjoyed my stay, would recommend, and am even thinking about renting it again for a Cubs outing in the works."
22651,Great experience and apartment like last time! Only caveat is that there is a room with a twin and maybe. Double/queen and the twin blocks the door from closing completely.
22651,Great location right next to wrigley. Easy to get keys and check in and check out.  Nice apartment.  
22651,"This has been a wonderful Airbnb experience to me, a first-timer. The apartment is spacious and clean, with everything a family needs to rest and have fun. Thanks JoAnne!"
22651,We were a last minute booking and the communication with JoAnne was great. Our family had 7 ppl and the property was fine for our short stay. It was much more affordable than booking a hotel especially for the location.  The optional garage parking is very convenient and safe. Finding street parking in the city without a permit is mission impossible.
22651,"I was worried about our stay since I booked my trip on a Friday night at almost 10 pm. I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. Relief soon overcame me as JoAnne replied to my request within ten minutes. Although we did not get to meet her, she was extremely kind and made it incredibly easy for us to reach her. Once we got to the place, we were pleased to see how spacious and true to the pictures it was. It is on a very nice location, very local and busy, both things we were after. The beds were extremely comfortable, that is something I remember the most, probably since we were so tired after visiting the city. She was kind enough to let us use the garage, which was perfect as we were not looking forward to street parking. The pantry was a but sparse, however we were not preoccupied since there were tons of local places with diverse cousines that were open 24/7. Definitely will be booking again! Thank you JoAnne."
22651,"JoAnne and the property were great!  It was a breeze to work with JoAnne, she is very quick to respond to questions and was very helpful.  The apartment was very nice, clean, and accommodating for my group and I. Its proximity to Wrigley Field is a major plus if you are looking to go to the ballpark.  Highly recommend JoAnne and this property!"
22651,Everything was as described in the listing. Except for a little miscommunication about the parking pass all went smoothly. Thanks!
22651,It was clean and as described. Will come back. She is a great host.
22651,"My family stayed at JoAnne's apartment in order to attend a Cub's game. It was extremely convenient. Clean, well appointed, great communication. We would definitely stay here again. "
22651,The building lies in a quite place. We an easily find the building through the description from JoAnne. The furniture inside is quite impressive. My classmates and I are all satisfied with the building.
22651,"We enjoyed our stay there. Great historic charm, fun, safe location in the city."
22651,Great home in a prime location.  We had everything that was promised and more.  Perfect for the Cubs game and experiencing Wrigleyville.
22651,"Joann is great to work with, very quick to answer questions. Condo is clean, and you can't beat the location. Will definitely stay here again!!"
22651,This was my first time using the airbnb app. I was very pleased with the smooth stay. Joanne responded very promptly and when I arrived  to the house everything was just as described and shown in the photos. The house was clean and very inviting. It's in a prime location and parking was not that bad. There are meters as well as permit parking. I would definitely stay in another property from joanne!
22651,"Great location, great apartment!"
22651,"Great location, unit, and host. Very clean unit and conveniently located within the city. Highly recommended! Thanks, Joanne!!"
22651,Excellent location.  Property was clean and will maintained.  JoAnne and Steve are easy to correspond with.  Proximity to Wrigley Field can't be beat!
22651,The house is comfortable and cozy. Recommend for family trip.
22651,Overall excellent. Simple and clean as described. Great location just down the street from Wrigley. Perfect for catching a game and enjoying the local nightlife. Easy to communicate with the hosts and they were flexible on check in / check out which was a big help.
22651,"Everything as described, right around the corner from Wrigley Field. Nice place. Thank you!"
22651,We stayed as a family and the apartment had three separate bedrooms that were well set up (we only used 2). The location is very close to the stadium and lots of places to eat. The area felt safe and being able to use the locked car park was a bonus.  The new bathroom is great but the water pressure wasn't super (maybe we couldn't work it properly!). The apartment is nicely furnished and is very funky and cosy.  We didn't meet the hosts but they were very responsive. 
22651,"Amazing location, clean, charming Apartment and very responsive owner!"
22651,"Great location! The apartment was very spacious and accommodated the 5 of us perfectly for the weekend. The only struggle we had was having only one bathroom for 5 people, but it all worked out for the most part. I would definitely recommend this spot to other friends visiting Chicago."
22651,"We rented all three of Steve and JoAnne's apartment for our family reunion. The apartments were spacious and had all the amenities we needed -plenty of towels, comfortable beds, and warm blankets. Steve and JoAnne answered every question we had in a timly fashion. The location was an easy walk to the L. Some great bars and coffee close by also. We would recommend these apartments for our friends and family in the future. "
22651,"Love their places, she knows what she is doing.......could use some coffee and creamers to go with that coffee maker...lol"
22651,"Steve And JoAnne (I think it was JoAnne) was very responsive to messages. The place was in excellent condition and only a few things were odd. For one, one of the rooms still had the AC in the wall without anything covering it to keep the heat in. That is, a few openings still let in a ton of cold and the AC unit didn't keep much cold out. Not a huge issue since we had very warm blankets provided but not ideal.

Lastly, I was asked if I wanted covered parking for $25 and when asked if there were other options, I was just reminded that there was covered parking for $25. When I asked the second time if there were other options, the host then told me they have parking permits available.

Make sure you ask for parking permits.

In the end, only a couple little issues were found and this place was great. Again, the host was very responsive to messages."
22651,"Excellent communication and beautiful furnishings make this an unusually great option for groups or families. The location is convenient to public transport; the difficult neighborhood parking is not an issue if you use the garage behind the building for a small extra fee, which I recommend. The coded entry buzzer is a real convenience, allowing you to enter without coordinating your arrival ahead of time.

This is one of the best-furnished places I've every stayed, and the pictures are pretty accurate. The bathroom is small but luxurious, and there are tons of extra towels, sheets, paper goods, etc.

The only real issue: pots/pans/cooking implements and some mugs were not completely clean. The rest of the place was spotless, so I think this was an oversight. There's not much in the way of staples, so if you're intending to cook even simple things, come prepared."
22651,We had great experience and the house Greg for family and the host they were so helpful anytime we need them and special time check in and out we would love come back again if the place is available 
22651,"The apartment was amazing, I had a wonderful time staying there, the way it looks on the pictures is the exact same way to expected, beautifully decorated with enough space for all your guest that stay there. It was amazing and I will in the future book and stay in this amazing apartment. You will not be disappointed."
22651,"My BF and I had a great time at this place. It's a beautiful 3 bedroom in the Wrigley Field district of Chicago. Plenty of things to do within walking distance like eating, drinking, shopping. 3 bars/restaurants right at the corner. Street parking available, but for $20 you can get garage parking. 

Apartment is clean and well maintained and you have multiple rooms to choose from.  "
22651,It was exactly how it was advertised. We had a great time and the owners are very responsive. 
22651,"This is a nice, homey, comfortable place in an old building, near Wrigley Field and a lively part of town, with good food and drink nearby, and conveniently located near the train system. Steve and JoAnne went above and beyond with helping us, as there were travel issues getting into town due to weather, and they were able to help us out with garage parking a rental car we didn't expect to have (street parking is difficult here). The kitchen is great, the beds are comfy, and although there is only one bathroom (which required some coordinating with 6 people), it is a really nice bathroom."
22651,We had a great stay. Steve and JoAnne were responsive and helpful. Street parking is a bit inconvenient but they offer garage just the back of the building. 
22651,We have stayed here before and it was the perfect place for our group of 7! Plenty of room for everyone and the beds are comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!
22651,"Clean and comfortable apartment. The owner answered all of our questions in a very timely manner. This apartment is very close to the red line, which was very convenient for us. I would take advantage of the garage parking offered by the owner. Street parking seems difficult and it was nice knowing our car was tucked away."
22651,Had a overall great experience and communication was right on. The location was also perfect too.
22651,It was a great experience staying here with its warm and beautiful decorations. The facilities are good and also the street outside  is quiet. The garage in the back of the house saved us lots of troubles too.
22651,The description of the apartment was very accurate. Very close to Wrigleyville and everything that area has to offer. Joanne and Steve were very accessible and easy to work with . I had 7 guests in the apt and they all fit very comfortably. I would stay in this apartment or an other room rented out by Joanne and Steve. 
22651,I had a very positive experience with Steve and JoAnne. They were able to accommodate me and 6 of my friends to enjoy the nightlife of Wrigleyville. You can't beat the location of this place. The apartment was very nice and clean. Also the beds were very comfortable. My friends and I hope to use their apartment again sometime in the future. They are very easy going hosts and extremely easy to contact and stay in touch with to answer questions.
22651,"Steve and JoAnne's apartment has it all! 
1) Proximity to Wrigley (and Wrigleyville bars) 
2) Tons of space for our group of 4
3) Accommodating and readily available hosts

My group visited for one night to catch a Cubs game and enjoy the surrounding bar scene. There was so much to do that we really didn't even get to spend that much time in the apartment! That being said, the place was clean and comfortable, and it fit our needs perfectly.

Steve and JoAnne were very responsive in the days leading up to our stay even though they were out of town. They were great hosts from afar, and I would definitely hope to stay here again if (when) I make it back to Chicago -- and hopefully for a whole weekend!

Maybe next time the Nats will beat the Cubs!!

Thanks for the hospitality."
22651,"JoAnne was awesome.  She was super communicative before and during our trip.  The apt. was beautiful and just as pictured.  Location? If you want to be right next to Wrigley and catch a Cubs game, you can't beat this place.

I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun Chicago weekend with friends."
22651,"Host was very helpful and quick to answer... Place was beautiful and cosy, very happy with the place look like the pics. "
22651,We stayed 2 nights in Wrigleyville and this was a great place. JoAnne responded to all of my questions and we had a fabulous weekend. We will look forward to booking this location again in the future. 
22651,Hosts were very kind and responsive. The place is close to Wrigley which is awesome but  very old school in decor and the place could have used a more thorough deep cleaning.
22651,"Location!  Location!  Location!  1 block from Wrigley Field - and all it has to offer.  5 blocks from a grocery store and several nice restaurants.  1 km from the Lake front pathway.  3 blocks from the Red Line...a 15 minute ride to downtown.  It is the perfect spot.

Our family of 5 easily fit into the 3 bedroom space.  

We would stay again, in a heartbeat!"
22651,We stayed the weekend for a concert. The place was exactly as described and very conveniently located. Would come back in a heart beat 
22651,Joanne was extremely accommodating as our host. Being honest and upfront with her is key as she will graciously do what she can to accommodate you and your party's needs. Beautiful bnb listing with great amenities and extremely close to Wrigley field. Will definitely continue to stay with Joannes listing in future Chicago trips. 
22651,"If you are heading to Wrigley, there is no better place to stay. The place is exactly how it was described and Steve & JoAnne were fantastic."
22651,Fantastic location and gracious hosts. 
22651,"Very convenient location! This was a very spacious apartment that can host many people comfortably. The kitchen doesn't have what I would consider to be high quality cooking equipment (pans, utensils, etc) but if you're looking to explore the dining options and great neighborhood, this place is great!"
22651,A perfect place for friends and family to have fun and relax 
22651,Great location! Would definitely stay here again.
22651,Huge and beautiful space! Everything was clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. Definitely recommend! 
22651,"A wonderful location! About a block to wrigley field and other concert venues (the metro) and bars. The house was beautiful, spacious and clean. Garage and street parking are both available as well. I would definitely stay here again."
22651,Wonderful location in Wrigleyville and very spacious place! 
22651,"Steve and JoAnne are awesome hosts, they communicated with me very well throughout the entire process and were so helpful. The location and actual apartment was fantastic, everything was available for me and my guests to use, and plenty of space. The location was great and so close to Wrigley field and to all the bars and restaurants! I would definitely recommend this place!"
22651,"Easy check in, large space, very close to public transit too."
22651,This is a great location and value! Highly recommend for anyone coming into town for some fun. 
22651,"We enjoyed our stay in Wrigleyville. The apartment was clean and set up well. The kitchen wasn't really set up to cook, but restaurants are in walking distance so that was fine. 
Joanne was quick to respond to any of our messages...

The only issue was with parking. If you bring a car you have to pay to park (street parking with permit only) which we didn't know until we were settled in for the evening. "
22651,This is the 3rd time we have stayed at this location and it was great for our group of 7! Plenty of space for everyone and the beds are comfortable. Great location for a day out in Wrigleyville!
22651,"The location was great, right down from the stadium. Plenty of restaurants, sights, and very close to  the metro line. The apartment was very nice and had plenty of room for the 6 of us. Overall it was great and hope to stay with them again soon."
22651,"A large space in a great location to party in Boystown or Wrigleville. Everything was great! One tip here- if you do want to cook, you'll need all the basics (except for salt and pepper)- but really there are so many places to go out around here, you don't need to cook at home!"
22651,Guys weekend in Wrigley.  Couldn't have been closer to the stadium. 
22651,"Great location! Spent the night after a game at Wrigley, really enjoyed the proximity to the ball field and to nearby restaurants. Apartment was as listed, very spacious and lots of sleeping room! Thanks to Joanne for working with us to get us switched to the lower apartment after one person in our group broke her leg. Would definitely stay here again!"
22651,This is a fantastic place to stay if you want to be close to Wrigley field. We were there when the cubs were out of town so it was a quieter area that day. It's a beautiful old fashioned building with great wood floors etc. 
22651,Great place-- we really enjoyed our stay! 
22651,This location was perfect for our trip. We attended a concert at Wrigley field which we walked to and from. House was clean and lots of beds to choose from. Only 1 bath but they had it stocked with lots of towels for our use. They even gave us a parking pass to use for the night. Thanks Steve and JoAnn!
22651,The place was perfect for a group of 6.  We were a block from Wrigley park and a lot of nightlife.  Would definitely go back again 
22651,Wonderful location and owner was very prompt to respond. 
22651,Steve and JoAnne made our trip hassle free by responding very quickly to our request and messages as well as being flexible with the check in time! The apartment was perfect for our needs and we loved being so close to Wrigley!! Would have no problem staying at this property again! 
22651,"Excellent Location, right next to Wrigley Field.    Space needs a bit of work."
22651,The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
22651,"Steve and JoAnne were great to work with, very responsive and helpful.  Nice to have a lot of space to spread out in with friends during our stay."
22651,Close to Wrigley
22651,Great Airbnb spot! Right next to wrigley field. Plenty of beds easy and convenient check in and out!
22651,This place was perfect for our needs and in a great central location.
22651,Great location write in Wrigleyville! Close to public transportation to travel throughout the city. Great hosts with great communication and accuracy!
22651,The location is great and the space accommodates 6-7 people comfortably.
22651,Great location in Wrigleyville.  Would definitely stay again.
22651,"This place is a must, communication is super easy and the place is very spacious. I would deffinetly reccomend staying here. I will be staying again in the future!"
22651,"Very spacious and great location. Thanks for everything! 

-Philip"
22651,Tight place! Awesome time!
22651,Shower was awesome maybe just some instruction on how to use it. Kind of fancy!
22651,Great place near nightlife in Wrigley Field. Extremely fast communication and very responsive host. Highly recommend.
22651,Close to all the action of Wrigleyville bars and steps to Wrigley Field. Some street noise. The place was more spacious than I thought it would be. Plenty of room for a group of people if you donâ€™t mind sharing one bathroom. Well maintained. Would stay again!
22651,"Quaint, clean place with excellent location. Great response time. Parking a bit pricey for time of year. Code didnâ€™t work in back entrance where we parked so that was a bit inconvenient and confusing. No coffee pot to make coffee which would be a simple amenity to fix. There is a Starbucks within waking distance which was a Godsend. Small fixes. Overall a great stay."
22651,Couldnâ€™t have picked a better place to stay in Chicago! Great location and a ton of space inside the apartment. Will definitely be back!
22651,"The place is great. Location can't be beat. Plenty sleeping accommodations. My issue is the hosts. First hosts were Sonia and Syed, then Steve and JoAnn now Jeff and JoAnn.  They accepted payment for parking in the garage then when we arrived they told us we had to park elsewhere that night.  Then they refused to refund payment for that night.  We paid $195 and parked in their garage two nights when our agreement was $45/night for 3 nights. It's a pity because this is a great house. I will not trust them again."
22651,Steve and JoAnne were great hosts. They accommodated all of our needs with no problems. The location of the apartment was better than we ever could have expected. Everything was clean and the beds were all comfortable. They have a great dining area and living room that made us feel right at home.
22651,"The location of this place is great, unfortunately that is the only positive aspect of our stay.  Five friends and I, three women and three men, were staying in the apartment, the women shared the room with three sleeping spots.  Our bedroom door would not close, leaving a five inch gap because the bed was in the way.  The apartment was generally dusty, and the worst part was when I pulled back the sheets of my bed there were multiple strands of dark hair from different parts of the body.  I texted Joanne to tell her and ask for clean sheets.  No response.  I texted again the next day, still no response.  I was very glad to be home after an uncomfortable weekend.  Itâ€™s a good thing we didnâ€™t spend too much time in the apartment."
22651,Jeff and JoAnneâ€™s place is conveniently located at the heart of Wrigleyville but tucked away just far enough to avoid the noisy pedestrian traffic. The accommodation is fantastic. Strongly recommend to any sizable group of people looking to have a comfortable stay in the area.
22651,"First I have to say the pictures are way better than the real, so a little disappointed when I checked in. I couldnâ€™t find the parking place which I paid for when I checked in but I canâ€™t reach the host for quite a while.
The location is great and the room is spacious, if you have a car the parking is 35usd per day."
22651,"Upon checking in we were told we could leave bags and come back after the place was cleaned. That was a positive since we arrived at noon. Apon dropping bags we found someone elseâ€™s luggage in our unit with a note saying they were checking in same day and not to remove luggage, groceries, etc. Stress level rises. We get ahold of owner who says she will resolve misunderstanding while we are out. We leave our luggage and when we return a few hours later our luggage is missing. The owner said she moved the wrong luggage... she moved our luggage to a different unit. I offer to go collect it and put other renters luggage in other unit. 6 bags upstairs and 4 down for the swap. Everyoneâ€™s flustered. Just unorganized and stressful to first find someone elseâ€™s luggage in your unit and then return after a few hours and your own luggage is missing. Stressful start... but ok a misunderstanding??? The place overall was just kinda dirty and dusty. The decor is ok but lots of fake, dusty plants and junk around. Dishes donâ€™t match. some dishes seemed dirty. I thought my sheets smelled like perfume and my friend said she saw hairs in hers. Just seemed like a rush job on cleaning and definitely potential for dirty sheets.There were 4 towels for a 3 bedroom unit. I requested 6-8 towels for 5 people and was told there would be plenty. 1 wash rag. No shower floor mat. The toilet paper roll holder was loose. The shower is seriously too complicated. Many lamps didnâ€™t work. The door to our bedroom only shut if you moved the bed. The bathroom â€œlockâ€ didnâ€™t work at all. The front door locks stuck and were challenging. No blow dryer as expected. I specifically asked if there was one to know if I needed to pack and was told yes. Then upon discovering there wasnâ€™t one (with wet hair and evening plans) it was suggested I go to another unit in the building to get one. The bed I slept in was very lumpy. The mattress seamed old and worn in in one large divot. The location was good. Thatâ€™s about the only positive thing I can say. I paid about $1600 for 4 nights and expected better. I donâ€™t consider myself high mainentance but all these little things just kinda add up and are disappointing. Sharing a towel with my husband and my kid so my friends can each have one... unacceptable. No counter cleaner of any kind to clean up after ourselves or just clean up in general. 5 people in one apartment for 4 nights youâ€™d like to be able to wipe stuff down here and there. The dining table had a glass top and underneath it was grimy and gross. The carpets seemed old and dirty and the lobby was littered with old carpets and just looked rundown. With more effort and care this could have been better. It..."
22651,"Great location, especially if you're looking to be close to Wrigley Field. Easily accommodated our group of 5, where we all got our own real bed. I would agree with other reviews that the photos make it look a bit better than the real life experience. No major complaints, just a bit of disappointment with simple things like no hand soap in the bathroom, a leaky kitchen faucet, older worn-out beds, and what looked like water damage in the bathroom ceiling. They did allow us to check-in extra extra early, which was super helpful with our travel plans. Definitely made for a good place to crash after a long, busy day in Chicago."
22651,.
22651,Perfect place to stay for our visit to wrigley field. So convenient to be able to walk to wrigley and all the surrounding restaurants and bars. Nice home with plenty of room for the 6 of us.
22651,Great hosts! Awesome communication. The place was very clean and perfect location near wrigley field. Hosts were flexible with checkin and checkout which was very appreciated. Great stay and would recommend!
22651,This airbnb was perfect for my group of friends and I for our 1 night stay in Chicago. Location was very nice! Jeff and Joanne were quick to respond with any questions we had.
22651,This place is in great location! Jeff and Joanne were super helpful!
22651,"Can't be better for location when attending an event at Wrigley! Lots of noise however in hallway and front door was not secure into building. A bit unnerving with all of the traffic both outside and inside the building. Other than that, would recommend!"
22651,Fantastic location within 1 block of Wrigley. Has plenty of space to accommodate 3 couples and still give them privacy. Newly remodeled kitchen and bathroom.
22651,"This is one spacious place! We had seven people and needed last minute accommodations in a good part of town. This place did just that. Located a few steps from Wrigleyville, there were plenty of restaurants and bars to check out. The doors were all unlocked when we walked in, so we were sure to check the entire place to ensure it was just us there, but besides that, it was a comfy stay and it was nice to have a kitchen and common space as well!"
22651,"The apartments in this building are always decent. Very roomy, great location. We've stayed in this building numerous times and I'm sure we will stay here again."
22651,"I have stayed with Jeff and JoAnn multiple times. This building is so close to Wrigley Field, if you were going to a game, especially with a large group of people, apartments 1 and 2 are great value with multiple beds in multiple bedrooms.  I highly recommend it"
22651,Wonderful location and very kind hosts!
22651,"We stayed for a weekend with a group of seven and were so happy to have chosen Jeff's and JoAnne's place. It was very spacious, clean and super convenient located.
JoAnne was very helpful and replied nearly instantly. It was a great experience and we will surely book this place again!"
22651,Great place!  Fantastic location!  Wish we could have stayed longer!
22651,"This place is a bit rundown. It would be good if you had a big group that was coming to party. We were not. The unit below this one had loud music playing all night, which kept us up. There was what appeared to be pet hair all over the queen bed's sheet. The twin bed I slept on was probably broken -- it was really saggy.  Communication was good and it was easy to get into."
22651,"Great response timing. Cool place, great location"
22651,It was a fun time! Would come back.
22651,Great hosts! Very accommodating!!
22651,Excellent place to stay
22651,Great location
22651,Perfect location to explore Wrigleyville. The apartment was very spacious and a good value for what I needed.
22651,Simply outstanding. Very convenient location. Would highly recommend.
