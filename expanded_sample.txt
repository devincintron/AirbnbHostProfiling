if you send packages to the apartment you should know there's not a doorman available 24/7, so the packages you receive are left in the front or back door and then put in a common room. 
i was a bit skeptical about this, however the two packages i had delivered were there waiting for me when i got back at the end of the day.
my stay with dominic was overall a great experience. 
while i never met him in person, check-in was easy and all other communications were very pleasant. 
the location for this space is great! you literally walk right out the door to the clark/division metro stop. 
the location is also great because you are walking distance to several grocery stores, pharmacies, and fun wells street where i found any type of restaurant you could possibly imagine. 
the space was perfect for what i needed.
i was in town for work and i after a long day, i needed a place to unwind and relax.
there were a few problems upon move in (broken light bulb and electrical outlet, tv with screen issues), that dominic arranged to have fixed by the building manager very quickly. there were a lot of little "extras" that i really enjoyed: plenty of towels, extra sheets, some cleaning supplies, extra pillows, kitchen essentials, etc.) the building was very safe and clean.
